            <p>Hello. I am using Kicksecure and Whonix on a virtual machine. Usually, I use live mode. If I delete these virtual machines, what level of danger exists in case of forensic examination? Or do these metadata not pose any danger? I understand that the best option would be to use Kicksecure-host in live mode, but I am interested in your opinion on virtual machines. Disk of course encrypted. There are many opinions on this topic. But you are the best security experts and I am very interested in your opinion. I think that the metadata in log does not pose a threat, otherwise you would not created Whonix and Kicksecure as virtual machines. But your answer is very important to me. Thank you</p>

<p>Can anyone help tell me what is going on and how to fix it?</p>
<p>Here is sample output running “timedatectl status” command in a template and appVM</p>
<p>Shouldn’t it be in sync with system clock ?</p>

            <p>I tried out the steps in this guide <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/solved-are-optical-drives-disabled-in-ks/972" class="inline-onebox">[SOLVED] Are Optical Drives disabled in KS?</a></p>
<p>But it didnt work, i might have disabled the UDF filesystem when editing the /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf</p>
<p>currently it is written like this: install udf /usr/bin/disabled-filesys-by-security-misc</p>
<p>idk if that means it is enabled or disabled. if it is disabled, is putting comments back onto the line all you have to do to enable? i have a feeling you have to remove the file “disabled-filesys-by-security-misc” but i figured i should ask here before trying anything.</p>
<p>all help is appreciated. the optical drive im using is the asus zen drive U9M and has worked out of the box on my laptop running Parrot OS.</p>

<p>However when I unplug my SSD or it comes unplugged somehow (has happened before) it doesn’t trigger a full shutdown?</p>
<p>Why doesn’t it fully shutdown when unplugged?<br>
I do want to add that also set up LUKS when I installed Debian.</p>
<p>Do I need to create a udev rule that runs a shutdown script (unmount, cryptsetup luksClose, and sync)?</p>

            <p>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It’s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, <a href="https://searchengine.party" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searchengine.party</a>, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users’ IP.<br>

            <p>Hello. How to use zulucrypt in USER mode / USER live mode? I received an important encrypted secret steganographic container in messenger, but I could not open it due to sudo restrictions. I need to reboot, decrypt file, and then load again in USER mode / live mode to respond to interlocutor. This will be inconvenient (this can be a confidential important conversation where time is crucial - for example, if it is related to investigative journalism). What would you recommend in this case? Installing zulucrypt in Podman or Distrobox?</p>
<p>ps Live mode SYSMAINT is very good for viewing encrypted containers and do not save secret session to disk, when you are not limited by time</p>

            <p>Patrick, does it make sense to limit live mode for increased isolation in user-sysmaint-split, given that disk writing is limited? Live mode is very convenient for testing packages, new programs before installing in PERSISTENT mode. Often I try to install some program, but during installation, I encounter dependency problems, library version issues… as a result, package either doesn’t work or can disappoint me. And then it is very convenient to reboot. Rather than deleting everything I just installed + no traces of such experiments are left on disk</p>

            <p>You can use Qubes OS the <em>secure OS</em> together with Whonix (anonymity). You can use Kicksecure the <em>security by default OS</em> with Whonix too through VirtualBox.</p>
<p>How should an user who is looking for security and anonymity decide between those operating systems?</p>
<p>The main advantage of Qubes OS is its isolated design. In combination with Whonix you have a gateway which enforces all traffic from all VMs going through Tor.</p>
<p>But you might use Kicksecure as your OS exclusively to start your VirtualBox instance and use Whonix from there for all your work or offline VMs. Kicksecure OS updates would go through Tor by default.</p>
<p>What are the drawbacks in such a setup for using Kicksecure compared with Qubes OS?</p>

            <p>I morphed my Debian into Kicksecure on an old Macbook. Before, the optical drive worked fine, now it’s not recognized at all (“eject” and “lsblk” don’t list it).<br>
My understanding is that the kernel KS uses is the same as Debian, but I also found that some kernel drivers a blocklisted for security reasons (such as firewire because it would enable known exploits).<br>
The problem is that I rely on the optical drive. Is there any way to enable it?</p>
<p>Edit: I found this: /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf<br>
Any idea which one is needed for and Apple MacBook2,1 SuperDrive?</p>
<p>SOLVED: by commenting out these lines:<br>
blacklist cdrom<br>
blacklist sr_mod</p>
<p>in:<br>
/etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_blacklist.conf</p>

</code></pre>
<p>is it possible to add a mount and launch virtual disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian.qcow2 (file itself is in /live/image) that it is launched in flows without consumption of additional memory? it will make a kicksecure a fantastically secure system (much cooler than qubes). live mode is perfectly launched by live-ISO, but how to avoid a load on memory with an already installed system, as is done with podman containers? solving this problem of memory load will help strengthen anti-forensicism. I use live mode every day, but even 32g of memory is not enough for working with VMs</p>

            <p>I was looking at <code>https://docs.clip-os.org/clipos/kernel.html#configuration</code>. But I couldn’t find configs such as: <code>CONFIG_BPF_JIT_ALWAYS_ON</code> etc set in kicksecure’s <code>security-misc</code> where I can find these configs if they even exist in Kicksecure?</p>

            <p>Hello lovely gentlemen, before I get going here I want to say a huge THANK YOU for selflessly automating so many good ideas in one place.</p>
<p>I’ve been unceremoniously digging into your wiki and general documentation, beginning (of course!) with a paradigm of Self Help <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating from GRUB to Systemd-Boot (formerly Gummiboot) and while the port has gone well, the kernel flag:</p>
<p>efi=disable_early_pci_dma</p>
<p>Works in GRUB, but prevents booting in systemd-boot.  Before I go blaming Mr. Poettering for his crimes against humanity (I jest) I wonder if the very intelligent people in this community - with years more experience in this platform than I - may have any thoughts on why this might be.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any insight, time, or just your thoughts.</p>
<p>PS: If you have any thoughts on UKI (Unified Kernel Images) and TPM bindings, I think I have a working layout but if perhaps there are gotchas to consider, or - and this is my greater fear - by switchinig out GRUB I may remove some hardening you have provided, I would certainly like to maintain all of that, and I would love a heads-up if I have wandered into a security minefield in my experimentations.  Thanks.</p>

<p>I would like to manually do the Kicksecure system modifications.</p>
<p>On the wiki I was only able to find instructions for downloading the pre-modified Kicksecure disc image, or installing a Kicksecure package using apt from within Debian.</p>
<p>Can you help with my goal?</p>

          <title>Current Kicksecure Bullseye repo lacks hardened-malloc packages?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I wanted to update a VM that has not been updated for a while.<br>
Unfortunately, the hardened-malloc package is no longer offered. Is there a reason for this and can the package be offered again via the Kicksecure Bullseye repo?</p>
<p>The hardened-malloc package is currently not available in any Bullseye repo, not in Stable, Stable Proposed, Testers, nor in Developers.</p>
<p>Last available version was:<br>
hardened-malloc (0:12.5-1) unstable<br>
