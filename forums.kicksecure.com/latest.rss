          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We can also support App-per-VM rollback, or install older version directly, if these (old) packages already exists in the repository (in case we gonna use something similar to nix or arch).</p>
<p>This approach doesn’t conflict with the core philosophy of keep it updated, as the primary focus remains on using updated software, not rollbacks.</p>

            <p>Although not a direct security issue on its own, systemd is a bulky piece of software and has been <a href="https://without-systemd.org/wiki/index_php/Arguments_against_systemd/">heavily criticized</a> for numerous things.</p>
<p>For linux there are init available check <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Comparison_of_init_systems#Init_system_comparison_table">here</a>.</p>
<p>For seL4 good news is that Genode OS has developed its own lightweight <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/21.05/system_configuration/The_init_component.html">init component</a>.</p>

            <p>There shouldnt be any old or nonsense software support in the system level (like IRC in the kernel?! or Floppy Disk Support…)</p>
<p>If necessary, such support may be possible within the App-per-VM (ApV) model, since it’s based on Linux and already includes support for these kinds of legacy features. However, this will never be a priority.</p>

            <p>Only x86 will should be supported, due to its widespread use (Intel or AMD CPUs or so). Support may be extended in the future to other freedom (or almost freedom) based architectures, such as RISC-V.</p>
<p>ARM or similar proprietary architectures will not be supported—there’s no reason to waste time on them. Supporting the most common proprietary architecture (x86) is sufficient. (Though seL4&amp;Linux supports ARM anyway).</p>

            <p>Rescue mode is like giving a backdoor to your own OS or software. If you break your system or forget your password, it’s your responsibility, no one else’s and no help will be provided, because there’s nothing anyone can do.</p>
<p>This also encourages users to maintain proper backups of their data, whether on their own hardware or in the cloud.</p>
<p>(Rollback and Snapshots helps as well)</p>

            <p>Note: This is written with the assumption of having a separation between the packages for the system differ from the packages for ApV.</p>
<p>Hosting our own packages on our own servers would be the ideal solution, and that’s true. However, with a small team and limited resources, that’s not currently feasible (though it should remains the long-term goal).</p>
<p>What we can do instead is source packages from existing systems, whether Nix, Arch, Gentoo, or others as long as we can obtain pure, upstream, patchless packages. Reproducibility is essential here to ensure that the packages have not been tampered with in the path of delivery.</p>
<ul>
<li>FSDG Consideration: This all can go through only supporting freedom software (software for the ApV must be taken from FSDG distro repository in this case).</li>
<li>Upstream package purity discussion can be found <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/secure-and-trustless-trust-minimal-package-policy/1157">here</a>.</li>

            <p>No Backward: The operating system will continue updating itself for supported XYZ hardware. Once any hardware becomes obsolete, it will no longer be compatible, no legacy support.</p>
<p>No Sideward: There will be no compatibility for Linux, Windows, or BSD software at the system level. Compatibility may exist in App-per-VM. By default, only Linux apps are supported in the VM (This case if the system using different kernel like seL4 or so, but if its using Linux then no other OS should be given/cared for compatibility, only the pure/original kernel with the main OS components)</p>

            <p>Instead of having software per user isolation (used in android), it will be each VM will run at the user level, and every VM will have its own dedicated user ID (and inside the VM where the app is installed). This isolation ensures that if a VM is compromised, it won’t lead to the compromise of all user packages or affect other VMs.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am using Kicksecure 17 as a template for sys-net in Qubes OS on multiple laptops.</p>
<p>One of the laptops has an Intel Alder Lake-P PCH CNVi WiFi adapter, but the iwlwifi drivers do not recognize this WiFi hardware.</p>
<p>I’ve researched this issue on other Linux distributions, and the common solution is to install the <code>backport-iwlwifi-dkms</code> package. However, this package is not available in the repositories currently configured in the Kicksecure template.</p>
<p>Can anyone suggest how to resolve this issue?</p>
<p>Although this response in another post is really discouraging, so I am not sure if I’ll receive any help here or not.</p>

sys-usb, sys-net are difficult enough to use in Qubes without Kicksecure being involved. 
I don’t want anyone’s sys-usb, sys-net issues caused by Qubes being blamed on Kicksecure and reported here. No time to investigate such issues. 
That’s all. If it works, then great.

          <title>Secure and Trustless/Trust Minimal Package Policy</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[nurmagoz]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The package is only going to be as secure and up-to-date as the upstream developers made it. There must be no interference or external involvement in adding or removing code from any package (no package maintainer, only to make the package work as is from the upstream).</p>
<h3><a name="p-2991-why-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2991-why-1"></a>Why</h3>
<p>We have the Debian design, and we’ve seen how flawed it is when it comes to security and feature fixes. It’s horrible in every aspect. What we get from Debian is, at best, working software, but that doesn’t mean it’s secure, up-to-date, or even always stable. Issues like packages crashing on shutdown when clicking X or freezing on specific Y action, are common (because they are already in the distro passing freeze timeline without upstream fixes), and such bugs when occurs are unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A major security flaw in Debian and Debian-like philosophies is that if the upstream of a package fixes a security issue and pushes it to their users, Debian remains unaware of it and will not include the fix in their own package unless it is documented or assigned a CVE. As a result, users remain vulnerable for up to maybe entire five years.</p>
<p>Another issue is the complexity trust in the chain of delivery. The more people who can add, remove, or manipulate the code, the more trust becomes a concern. If the code goes from developer X to intermediary Y (or even more intermediaries) before reaching the user, then the user must trust not only X but also Y and anyone else in the chain. Moreover, X doesn’t know Y or their practices, so X must also trust Y not to tamper with the code before reaching the user. This design introduces unnecessary trust assumptions. Code must be delivered directly from X to the user.</p>
<p>Note: Operating system developers should only interact with core/system-level packages, such as the kernel or desktop environment or VM configs or so.</p>

            <p>Sadly, there is no reliable or usable freedom operating system based on a microkernel design (yet). What we have are only monolithic ones, based on the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Linux, by design, does not offer the same level of security as a microkernel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate#Continued_dialogue">It is considered obsolete</a>; nobody would want to build an operating system from scratch based on a monolithic design in nowadays.</p>
<p>Alternatives?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sel4.systems/">seL4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.redox-os.org/book/microkernels.html">Redox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel">Zircon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All mentioned are in active development and free software (sel4 is copyleft).</p>
<p>What i would avoid for sure is Zircon, because its google based.</p>
<p>What’s left are seL4 and Redox. Both are good, and if I had to choose one, I would choose seL4 due to its maturity.</p>
<p>Note (1): Minix and GNUmach are inactive.<br>
Note (2): Hybrid kernel is not an option.</p>

<p>Proprietary competitors are on the rise. HarmonyOS, for example, is arguably the most mature general-purpose microkernel-based OS developed in China. Google’s Fuchsia is another example. If we don’t stay ahead of these developments, control over security will slip from our hands, placing it instead in the hands of large corporations or state-backed entities.</p>

            <p>Just wanted to post this here for other users that may using keepassxc with TOTP and it failing to spit out correct codes related to sdwdate issue bellow.</p>
<p>I went to set up TOTP inside keepassxc and it kept failing to give the right codes. This led me to figure out that the time has to be correct for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Since I was using a VPN auto connect it would sometimes cause sdwdate to time out due to [VPN → Tor → sdwdate] slow connection or whatnot.</p>
<p>Once I synced sdwdate the issue was resolved.</p>

            <p>Based on my past experience with operating systems and software, there is still no great secure operating system developed, especially one based on free software. Most of the necessary software exists, but the challenge lies in integrating it all into a cohesive whole to produce the most secure operating system.</p>
<p>What I will add here are software that already exist in reality, not theoretical ones.</p>

    Sadly, there is no reliable or usable freedom operating system based on a microkernel design (yet). What we have are only monolithic ones, based on the Linux kernel. 
Linux, by design, does not offer the same level of security as a microkernel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate#Continued_dialogue">It is considered obsolete</a>; nobody would want to build an operating system from scratch based on a monolithic design in nowadays.

<p>Realistically, having pure packages working directly with seL4 is not practical. It could take 10 to 20 years or even longer. (Linux has been around for over 30 years, and there are still packages that are Windows-only.)</p>
<p>So to solve this issue, we gonna use an already functional kernel which is linux!.. ok hold on a second didnt we just say that linux is a bad design? Thats correct if its used as the main operating system kernel, but if its used in a VM and that VM runs only a single application like firefox or thunderbird…etc the danger drastically decreased/minimized.</p>
<p>Note: AppArmor, SELinux, Firejail, Containers… all are flawed designs when it comes to relying on them for security with packages running on Linux directly on hardware.</p>

    We can also support App-per-VM rollback, or install older version directly, if these (old) packages already exists in the repository (in case we gonna use something similar to nix or arch). 
This approach doesn’t conflict with the core philosophy of keep it updated, as the primary focus remains on using updated software, not rollbacks.

            <p>I’ve used only Windows since the 80s, so my experience is limited. As I’ve learned about security I’ve become aware of the “Lack” thereof. Last couple of years I’ve been wanting to learn about Whonix which has a reputation for being Secure. However, I don’t know if I should keep the installation of Whonix as a goal in light of the interview with a Whistleblower US Gov’t IT specialist I heard the other night on a Podcast? He worded for US Gov’t in 2016 to a latter date. He became high ranking, and knowledgeable. He reports Microsoft as having the contract with all systems across the Federal Gov’t. He also reports he witnessed Microsoft Tech were ordered to act as “Escorts” to Chinese IT Tech personnel who were stationed in China. These “Escorts” supposedly acted as guides to allow access to the Chinese Tech on all levels? This will become very controversial since the President at the time (Obama) reportedly signed off on it. This is the background to my question since the Whistleblower also reported the “Escorts” also were used with Oracle! So, my question is was or is your Whonix product compromised, and/or is it now secure?</p>

          <title>Kicksecure distro specific keyboard shortcuts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[init38]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well I wanted to give some feedback on accessibility/productivity via keyboard shortcuts that would be nice to have in Kicksecure. Xfce is a little different then others but I recall that the Xfce version of Manjaro had shortcuts specific to that OS even on Xfce. In fact I’m more then sure there was another distro that was discontinued but specifically had keymaps set for Chromebook hardware but I don’t member the name? It did however use Xfce as desktop env is what I’m getting at.</p>
<p>I manually created some keyboard shortcuts but these would make Kicksecure more productivity appealing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whiskermenu shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>Super key for menu drop down “Super L” for fast searching</p>
<p>command: <code>xfce4-popup-whiskermenu</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshot shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>Set to the “Print key” but some layouts might be the “End” key</p>
<p>command: <code>xfce4-screenshooter</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Lockscreen shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>“Super + L” just like windows has for locking your workstation when leaving your desk.</p>
<p>command: <code>xscreensaver -lock</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Notepad shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>“Super + N” or “Super + M” for mousepad since its the default notepad on xfce.</p>
<p>command: <code>mousepad</code></p>
<p>Volume controls (my hardware was not detected)</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume up</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume down</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Mute</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle</code></p>
<p>Looking into how Kicksecure could set distro specific keyboard shortcuts would make it more complete since my assumption is Xfce is gonna stay.</p>
<p>P.S. Is there any other DE spins going to made for future releases?</p>

            <p>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:</p>
<p>dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory</p>
<p>reboot: system halted</p>
<p>From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)<br>
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</p>

            <p>Detailed overview of the issues with stable and rolling release distributions: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Stable_vs_Rolling_Distributions" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stable vs Rolling Distributions - Security Analysis</a></p>
<p>Kicksecure’s current development strategy for the most part has been to harden Debian as much as is practically possible. This seems to have been working well for the most part, but there are some worries about the safety of some of the rather outdated software that Debian provides us. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical, extremely complicated software like Firefox ESR and Thunderbird can sometimes get stuck with a known-vulnerable version in the latest version of Debian Stable for as long as a month.</li>
<li>Software that isn’t well-maintained may be left in a vulnerable state for long after the vulnerability is made public. (This happened with the zuluCrypt vulnerability discovered in Debian’s zuluCrypt packaging a couple weeks ago or so.)</li>
<li>Tangential to the above, bugs that aren’t considered to be that big of a deal may not be fixed in a stable release of Debian ever. This isn’t really a security issue necessarily, but it is a problem from a usability standpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things would be more-or-less resolved if Kicksecure was a rolling-release distro, for instance by rebasing our code onto a rolling-release variant of Debian (if one were to exist - we sort of almost have one with Debian Testing, but it doesn’t quite serve the desired purpose perfectly). This however is not necessarily more secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling-release distros rolled out backdoored XZ code to end-users during the xz-utils attack. Thankfully (most of) those distros don’t seem to have been targeted by the backdoor at all, but in principle a backdoored upstream or similar supply chain attack can have a much worse impact when using a rolling release.</li>
<li>Rolling releases steadily introduce the latest bugs and vulnerabilities from upstream into the distro on a regular basis. (There isn’t really any way around this, this isn’t a criticism half so much of a statement of fact.) For software that isn’t so complex as to be riddled with unknown vulnerabilities like web browsers, this is a potentially increased danger.</li>
<li>Rolling releases can break a lot. An experienced user can go years or even over a decade without breaking a rolling release install beyond repair, but an inexperienced user can end up with a broken system within a few weeks if they accidentally do something like upgrade their system without checking what packages will be removed in the process. (I’d like to think I’m an experienced user, and I’ve nuked Debian Sid virtual machines multiple times doing this. Not fun.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be possible to combine the advantages of both stable and rolling releases, by keeping Kicksecure’s stable base, but offering “rolling” versions of specific packages like web browsers, email clients, (maybe?) media viewers, etc. Anything that has to handle highly complex untrusted data would be a good candidate for this sort of thing, especially software with a rapid-release cycle. We’re already moving in this direction to some decree with <a>Browser Choice</a>, which is in active development.</p>
<p>What are everyone’s thoughts on the above? Where could our docs use improvement? Are there ideas for how to get the best of both worlds (rolling and stable) other than just a stable base with specific rolling apps? What are some other apps we should probably think about making rolling or recommending that people install rolling versions of if they use those apps? Are there potential pitfalls we need to avoid with rolling apps? (On this last point, we probably should not do what KDE neon did to try to make the Qt and KDE stacks rolling on top of base Ubuntu - that way of doing things kept breaking things for people alarmingly frequently.)</p>

<p>Debian, of course, is a very good OS.<br>
But unfortunately, it and its core contain blobs and proprietary firmwares.</p>

Project PureOS has an exceptionally clean kernel and no proprietary firmwares and drivers (and even an open BIOS).</p>

but after i try to upgrade nonroot it spits out the following errors:</p>
<p>E: Release file for tor+https://deb.debian.org/debian/dists/bookworm-updates/InRelease is not valid yet (invalid for another 3h 28min 51s). Updates for this repository will not be applied.<br>

zsh: exit 100   sudo apt update</p>
<p>when i do sudo apt update and upgrade it upgrades about 250mb of data witholding what i assume is the files that fail with the nonroot method</p>

            <p>Is there a way to download older versions of the software specifically the one before the system split.</p>
<p>While i think its a great feature it is causing me too much pain in the ass.<br>
Also today i installed it in a new hard drive and the option to remove systemsplit is gone completely.</p>
