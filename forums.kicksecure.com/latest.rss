          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi All, I’m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use <code>history -c &amp;&amp; history -w</code>. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn’t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.</p>
<p>These “Apps” should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</p>

In all other VMs i change the ipv4 to manual<br>
address: 10.152.152.12 Netmask:255.255.192.0 Gateway: 10.152.152.10 DNS: 10.152.152.10<br>
And it works just fine, however when i do the same in a kicksecure VM…crickets.<br>
What am i doing wrong my duck search didnt provide any workarounds.</p>

            <p>I want to follow this tutorial:<br>
monero (dot) how/tutorial-how-to-speed-up-initial-blockchain-sync<br>
So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there</p>
<p>However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.<br>
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?</p>
<p>Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</p>

            <p>Is there anyway to prevent or “blacklist” certain packages from being installed?<br>
I tried creating a preferences file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist</code> to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
</code></pre>
<p>However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true?</p>
<p>If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It might be a good idea to to look at including the <code>tlp</code> and <code>tlp-rdw</code> packages</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLP supplies separate settings profiles for AC and battery power and<br>
can enable or disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and WWAN radio devices upon<br>
system startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting in the <code>/etc/default/tlp config</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># Sets the charge threshold to 80% similar to windows settings as to not overcharge the battery when AC is plugged in
TLP_BATTERY_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS="75 80"
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># This sets the default screen display brightness when on battery to 75 and 100 when plugged in
TLP_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS_ON_AC=100
TLP_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS_ON_BAT=75
</code></pre>
<p>Another suggestion would be disabling “GNOME animations” which could<br>
equal Improved Performance, Faster Response Time, and Battery Saving.</p>
<p>Adding these two lines to a custom dconf <code>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[org/gnome/desktop/interface]
enable-animations = false
</code></pre>

</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disable desktop effects</strong> <em>(Linux Mint or Cinnamon Desktop Environment)</em></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.effect show-desktop false
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Disable compositing for full-screen windows</strong> <em>xfce</em> (may also apply to other Desktop Environments)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/use_compositing -s false
</code></pre>
<p>(The global config or a user custom specific file should be located in <code>/etc/xdg/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/</code>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disabling compositing may improve performance for certain applications, especially games or video players, but it may also disable some visual effects and features like transparency and shadows. If you want to re-enable compositing later, you can follow the same steps and check the options again with “true” instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>On KDE If you want to disable the compositor entirely</strong> (which will affect all windows, not just full-screen ones), you can do so with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kwriteconfig5 --file kwinrc --group 'Compositing' --key 'Enabled' 'false'
qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor suspend
</code></pre>
<p>To re-enable it, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kwriteconfig5 --file kwinrc --group 'Compositing' --key 'Enabled' 'true'
qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor resume
</code></pre>

          <title>Installing FDE LUKS with Detached LUKS header option</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JuicyOdds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You know there are great things that have been discussed/mentioned in the other thread called “BusKill” which shreds the LUKS header. Which leads to the data being useless due to it being no different then random data forensically.</p>
<p>Instead of that it would be better if Kicksecure developed the feature and option when selecting Full Disk Encryption via LUKS at installation. <strong>To have the option to detach the LUKS header</strong> and store it on another device whether that be a USB, SD Card, Smart Card, Yubikey, Nitrokey, etc.</p>
<p>The main development would be the integration into Grub as it would have to ask for device or detect a saved device that has the luks header aswell as ask for the passphrase. The other integration would be into the graphical installer (e.g. Calamares) for selecting such a option.</p>
<p>Currently there is no option to set up a Linux install with FDE and a detached header. However this implementation would greatly servers and personal computers alike.</p>
<p>Here is a good read about this topic.</p>
<p>skrilnetz .net/bullet-proof-data-encryption-with-luks-and-a-detached-header/</p>
<p><strong>In summery here are the Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: – By separating the header from the encrypted data, users can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their encrypted storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: – Users can choose to store the header in a more secure location, such as a different device or a secure cloud storage solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Usability</strong>: – This feature would cater to advanced users who require additional security measures for their sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plausible Denial</strong>: – By using a detached header, users can claim that the encrypted storage contains random data, as the absence of the header makes it impossible to decrypt the contents without the correct key. This provides a layer of plausible deniability, as users can assert that they do not possess the means to access the data.</p>
</li>

            <p>At the time of writing, verified boot with reasonable security and usability using user-custom keys for Open Source Linux desktop distributions comparable to some Android hardware is unavailable due to a lack of hardware/firmware support (at least on the Intel/AMD64 platform).</p>
<p>The gigantic <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> wiki page has grown as large as it has because <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> and I have been trying to wrap our heads around how verified boot with reasonable security, usability, and user-custom keys for Open Source (Linux) distributions, comparable to some Android hardware, could be implemented.</p>
<p>Sponsor PUP (related: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency">Transparency</a>) will pay an OEM with firmware development skills to revise that wiki page with the goal of drafting a concept on how this could be implemented and identifying areas that might require further research.</p>
<p>If we are lucky, and if financially feasible, this might result in the development of hardware/firmware that allows for full verified boot to be implemented and actually realized.</p>

          <title>Onion APT repositories connection timeouts solution?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Quiksilver]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Tor onion APT repositories can sometimes fail when updating. This can can happen due to the slowness of generated onion circuits or having a custom <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> can cause them to timeout when updating.</p>
<p>In fact the Tails project since 6.4 removed the onion Debian repositories</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to using HTTPS addresses instead of an onion addresses for the Debian and Tails APT repositories. This makes the Additional Software feature more reliable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tails.net/news/version_6.4/index.en.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tails - Tails 6.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I created a config <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout</code></p>
<p>(15 seconds till timeout, 5 seconds till retry, and retries 3 times.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Acquire::http::Timeout "15";
Acquire::http::Retry-After "5";
Acquire::Retries "3";
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure how the integration tor and APT works but this would only effect http repos which also are what onions are.</p>
<p>This configuration seemed to work for me but I’m not sure if this fix is placebo?</p>
<p>In closing I don’t think Kicksecure should follow the same route of removing Onion repositories or Onion Debian repositories as thats one thing i strongly disagree with choice of the other project.</p>

            <p>Hi guys. I am using Kicksecure on a virtual machine. Host is ubuntu. I really like ubuntu. in the documentation you say Kicksecure used to work on ubuntu, but you chose debian because of potential problems with canonical. in the documentation you say grub-live can work on ubuntu /wiki/Grub-live#Compatibility, but I tried installing it on ubuntu, mint 22 and kubuntu and grub menu item does not appear. please help me what I should change in code to make it work on ubuntu. I would like to be able to run live mode for the whole system. this could be an additional defense for those using Kicksecure on an ubuntu host. thank you</p>

            <p><strong>Proposal for</strong> <strong>Exclusive Authentication Token</strong>:</p>
<p>system multifactor auth and killswitch in one user-tethered dongle</p>
<p>Secure boot can be implemented in Kicksecure for platform binding, but what about other hardware-engaging options like locking LUKS with a security key?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>search: support nitrokey com – Unlocking LUKS with a USB key on Fedora/Qubes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>search: Fedora forum - which dracut method (Yubikey)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does the Kicksecure team think about measured boot (HEADS BIOS) and Anti-Evil Maid (see AEM - Qubes OS + TPM)?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>BusKill</em> by Michael Altfield (on github) utilizes an app that triggers a hotplug removal event (in libusb) and a specific drive and port can be designated (usb: 00x , 00x) so that other USB devices do not trigger the shutdown.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>a single usb device could both</strong> authenticate LUKS cryptab with FIDO (biometric and/or unique physical token) and trigger a hotplug removal event in libusb on the BusKill application (python, sha256, .btz).</p>
<p>Would Kicksecure approve of this feature or can anyone on the development team find any security flaw with this technique being implemented?</p>
<p>In TAILS OS, all one has to do is attach a lanyard to the TAILS USB device and wrap the cord around your wrist. If the computer is forcefully removed from you, both the shutdown sequence is initiated and the RAM is cleared and persistent storage is again locked in the FDE state. However, if developer mode is and security-misc is fully enabled on Kicksecure, one has to wait for sudo shutdown and if unencumbered on the stable or testing mode, the computer could be stolen while in an unlocked state.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I just did a full upgrade and now I get prompted to unlock the keyring for Brave browser everytime its launched.</p>
<p>In the past when I was distrohopping another distro that had xfce I would get that same prompt with Ungoogled-chromium and also Vivaldi which are both chromium based.<br>
Its weird considering I never even use a browser keyring password manager I dont get why it prompts this.</p>
<p>Anyway the fix always used to be purge <code>gnome-keyring</code> however this doesn’t seem to be the best choice.</p>
<p>When you type <code>sudo apt purge gnome-keyring</code> it will show the other dependencies to remove are <code>kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce</code> and other Kicksecure specific ones so obviously I chose NOT to go forward.</p>
<p>The only fix in the meantime that is better is to add the chrome flag <code>--password-store=basic</code> which will ingore using GNOME keyring or kwallet (KDE).</p>
<p>So you would edit your launcher <code>Exec=/usr/bin/browser --password-store=basic</code> for the browser application or you could edit your <code>/usr/share/application/browser.desktop</code> file for desktop file but this might get updated with new updates so launcher seems like the safer bet.</p>
<p>Back to the point why is gnome-keyring dependency needed and could something be added to Kicksecure like above to automatically fix this pesky issue or to the wiki regarding chromium unlock keyring prompt with gnome-keyring.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong> add the chrome flag <code>--password-store=basic</code></p>

            <p>Apologies, I accidentally posted on Whonix Forums.</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to get Wayland working with Kicksecure/KVM.</p>
<p>Installing a Wayland compositor like sway or labwc in XFCE Kicksecure is not an option, due to the qemu bug which rotates the cursor by 180 degress. This happens with any DE that doesn’t fully integrate Wayland. (sway issue <span class="hashtag-raw">#6581</span> on git)</p>
<p>Using Kicksecure with LXQT or KDE which have native Wayland support fixes that issue. (already tested with CLI Version)</p>
<p>Can I simply replace or add a few packages in Derivative-Maker to achieve this?</p>
<p>Looks like <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>, lists the following meta-packages and their dependencies (containing all xfce packages) which could be changed to install LXQT instead of XFCE:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kicksecure-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce
kicksecure-shared-host-xfce
.......etc
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfce4 &gt; lxqt
mousepad &gt; featherpad
xfce4-terminal &gt; qterminal
....etc
</code></pre>
<p>After some more digging the variable <code>dist_build_script_build_dependency</code> in <code>build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine</code> contains all the packages listed in <code>kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>.</p>
<p>I keep seeing <code>"$@"</code> in  <code>3500_install-packages</code> later on, so I’m assuming some of the packages are passed as an argument to the install functions.</p>
<p>My plan would be to either switch the xfce packages to lxqt in <code>/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code> or if that’s no good then sed replace them in the variable that holds all install dependencies.</p>
<p>Finally, config stuff seems to be handled by <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/desktop-config-dist</code>. There I’d just replace <code>/etc/skel/.config</code> xmls with lxqt ones.</p>
<p>Is that pretty much it or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

          <title>Reducing the risk of installing malicious apt packages?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(Was waiting for a very long software build to finish and this idea popped into my head, so I decided to write it up and post it.)</p>
<p>A distro’s package manager is an interesting potential malware vector for a number of reasons. They are implicitly trusted by the distribution as being a safe source of software. The fact that these repositories are maintained by distributions and don’t simply allow anyone to throw software onto them increases their trustworthiness, and thus increases a user’s likelihood to treat them as entirely safe. Even though I do not (any longer) trust a distro’s official repos to be totally safe, I do generally trust <code>sudo apt install</code> to be more safe than most other ways of obtaining software.</p>
<p>However, while a distro’s repositories are indeed <em>more</em> safe than using the Internet at large as your software repository (thanks Windows for proving that), that doesn’t mean that a package manager is entirely safe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Very little code review is generally done when packaging a software application for several major distributions, including Debian. Debian does not require (or even particularly encourage) packagers to do a code review, and the people who review new packages to ensure they are suitable for inclusion into the Debian archives mostly check that the <em>packaging</em> looks good, not the code of the application. As a result it is very possible for a malicious package to be introduced into the archive on accident. Similarly, it’s possible for malicious code to be introduced into a previously legitimate application without anyone noticing. (This has happened at least twice before, once very notably in the xz-utils incident, and once in a <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-infection-proves-windows-malware-monopoly-is-over-gentoo-ships-backdoor-updated/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">lesser-known backdoor attack on the UnrealIRCD server, which affected Gentoo</a>. That second attack <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/linux-infection-proves-windows-malware-monopoly-is-over-gentoo-ships-backdoor-updated/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">went undetected for six or seven months</a>.)</li>
<li>Once a packager gets a package into the archive, they can provide updates for it <em>in Debian Unstable</em> with no or very little supervision. This is especially true if the packager is a Debian Maintainer (thus able to upload specific packages without needing a sponsor) or a Debian Developer (thus able to upload an update to any package without needing a sponsor). A malicious or compromised DM or DD could thus potentially introduce malicious code into the archive without being noticed. Supplying updates for a package in a stable release is harder and would probably not be so easy to compromise in this way thankfully, but you still are putting your trust in the DMs and DDs of Debian, which could be poorly placed. Remember that Jia Tan was fully trusted and that turned out to be a bad idea.</li>
<li>Many software applications in Debian are outdated, meaning they could carry severe security-related bugs that make them unsafe to use even if they contain no intentionally malicoius code. The Chromium browser package is a good example of this - it was so often out-of-date that the Linux Mint developers <a href="https://blog.linuxmint.com/?p=3978" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">decided to build it themselves for LMDE</a>. Chromium, despite its apparently good security design, is also a massive source of security vulnerabilities probably because it is such a popular application and thus everyone’s looking for vulnerabilities in it. The problems with Chromium might not be as bad now as they were back then, but this kind of thing is still worrying.</li>
<li>There are also packages that Debian just refuses to provide security support for because they’re so hard to support. I can’t remember an example right off the top of my head, but <code>check-support-status</code> can be used to find packages one has installed that fall into this category. I seem to remember something WebKit related warning me about this once.</li>
<li>Users may enable third-party repositories to get software that isn’t available from the Debian archives, or that is outdated in Debian. These repositories are probably OK if the user is installing software from an official upstream source, but there’s nothing stopping someone from making a malicious Debian repo that advertises newer versions of outdated software to make itself attractive. There’s also the incident with a <a href="https://debugpointnews.com/free-download-manager-debian/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">malicious third-party repo for Free Download Manager</a>, which involved a compromise of the authentic Free Download Manager website. (That attack went undetected for <a href="https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/blog/?p=664" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">around two years</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these issues could potentially cause serious trouble even for a security-conscious user, and to my awareness no major operating system (Linux or otherwise) makes any attempt to significantly mitigate the risks these kinds of attacks introduce. (Debian’s <code>check-support-status</code> <em>helps</em>, but it only helps with one particular scenario, and it’s not even installed by default on Debian systems as far as I know. Similarly Windows’ and MacOS’s restrictions related to signed code can make it more difficult to run code by people who don’t provide a clear link between their software and their identity, but there’s nothing stopping someone from just publishing signed malicious code, plus identity theft is a thing.) The user is left to figure out what they do or don’t trust by themselves, and while the user should <strong>always</strong> be the final authority on what is or isn’t trusted, it should be recognized that some users are just plain bad at making good decisions about what to trust. As the saying goes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_pigs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“Given a choice between dancing pigs and security, users will pick dancing pigs every time.”</a></p>
<p>How could we harden apt in order to make this problem less of a problem? We <strong>absolutely should not block users from installing software</strong> regardless of what that software is, but it might be a good idea to do something so that the user is given some pause for thought before doing something they probably shouldn’t do. One potential idea might be to wrap <code>apt install</code> commands to see what packages a user is trying to install, determine what sources apt will choose for installing these applications, and then check them against a database of “known good software” and another database of “known bad software”. If the user is trying to install something that isn’t explicitly trusted, they’ll get a warning they can click through, and if they’re trying to install something that is explicitly distrusted, they’ll get a dire warning that requires some effort to bypass. (Or maybe we make all warnings like this require some effort to bypass, although we do have to be careful that we don’t get backlash for “locking down” the OS if we go that route, then again I don’t think users expect us to be trying to mess up our users like Microsoft or Apple might do.) As for how these databases are built, we could add everything that is part of Kicksecure by default to the database, plus a bunch of widely-used software that isn’t suspected to be intrinsically dangerous. Specific third party repos for software like Element, Google Chrome, or Visual Studio Code could also be added. (Yes, I know that Google Chrome is debatable when it comes to whether it’s intrinsically dangerous or not, but you get my point.) We’d probably get some user complaints if we did this sort of thing, but we could always expand the database if people find things that we can determine are widely used, and for those who are using niche applications, they can expand the database themselves. This is just one potential application, I don’t know for sure if this is the best way of doing this, but it might work.</p>

          <title>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</title>

            <p>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</p>
<p>We should consider adding Virtualbox to Kicksecure by default, maybe only for Kicksecure Live USB at least (virtualbox is there before installation, but not after, to reduce attack surface). This will make possible to run any virtual machines from a plausibly-deniable external drive without leaving a trace on the computer. This also helps to reduce attack surface for the host os (kicksecure live usb), as it is amnesic and it is harder for malware to persist, especially with physical write-protection switch enabled.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Live USB → Virtualbox/KVM → Whonix VM/other OS.</p>
<p>Something like this could be done if Kicksecure was installed on the usb drive and the virtualbox installed on it manually, and after that user must be careful to launch live-mode only every time. But this is not as plausibly-deniable as a plain Kicksecure installation media, and it is obvious that Virtualbox was installed there for a reason. If every Kicksecure installation out there contained Virtualbox by default, it would be impossible for an attacker to claim that someone installed virtualisation software for a purpose of hiding something.</p>
<p>Essentially I am talking about something like HiddenVM mod for TAILS but with proper hardened nature of Kicksecure.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, at least we should consider creating a wiki-guide with information on how to add Virtualbox in Kicksecure Live Installation USB manually.</p>
