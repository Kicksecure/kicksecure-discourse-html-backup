          <title>Dracut compression research</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Patrick asked me to look into the compression options offered by Dracut for initramfs compression. This is the results of that research, written here since the results are a bit lengthy and require the ability to post images for sharing the charts I made.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: I think we should use xz compression. It’s acceptably fast, it compresses way better, and there doesn’t seem to be any compelling reason to avoid it.</strong></p>
<p>The initramfs has to be decompressed by the kernel on boot, so I only researched compression algorithms supported by the kernel in Debian Bookworm. (Trixie supports the exact same compression algorithms, so this research should apply to Trixie as well, assuming the compression utilities perform similarly in Trixie to how they perform in Bookworm, which I find likely given the age of these utilities.)</p>
<p>Bookworm’s kernel and Dracut both support the following compression algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>gzip (this is what we’re using now)</li>
<li>lz4</li>
<li>lzma</li>
<li>lzo</li>
<li>xz</li>
<li>zstd</li>
<li>cat (uncompressed, taken into consideration to provide a best-case scenario for time and a worst-case scenario for size)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dracut also supports bzip2, but Bookworm’s and Trixie’s kernels both did not appear to support that.</p>
<p>To determine which algorithm was most likely desirable, I benchmarked them against each other. The following testing methodology was used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file, <code>/etc/dracut.conf.d/99-compress.conf</code> to set the compression algorithm in.</li>
<li>For each compression algorithm, change <code>99-compress.conf</code> to specify the desired algorithm, then run <code>time sudo dracut --force</code> three times.</li>
<li>Record the output of <code>time</code> after each dracut invocation.</li>
<li>Record the size of the output initramfs after each dracut invocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all instances, the file size of the output initramfs was identical (to within a kilobyte at least) across all three runs of Dracut when using a single compression algorithm, so I only recorded file size once per algorithm. All tests were run in a KVM/QEMU virtual machine with 4 virtual CPUs, 4 GB RAM, and all host CPU features passed through to the guest (<code>-cpu host</code>). The host system has an i9-14900HX processor. The raw results of the benchmarks are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>gzip
<ul>
<li>run 1: <code>0.06s user 0.10s system 1% cpu 12.240 total</code></li>

<p>I did not benchmark boot speed with each of the different algorithms used, although I did verify that the virtual machine booted with an initramfs made with each algorithm. The boot speed seemed pretty much the same to me with each algorithm, and would have been difficult to measure in an objective, reliable fashion. I will note, I may have noticed a very slight speedup during boot with the zstd algorithm.</p>
<p>The following two graphs are provided to visualize the data above (created using LibreOffice):</p>

<p></p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/2bd2414d9be6f209da5f48a7de40331332b64632.png" data-download-href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/2bd2414d9be6f209da5f48a7de40331332b64632" title="initramfs-gen-efficiency"><img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/2bd2414d9be6f209da5f48a7de40331332b64632.png" alt="initramfs-gen-efficiency" data-base62-sha1="6fF02CNFpWuQxjjDkTxl0imYZz4" width="605" height="340"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Takeaways from the above data:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a size standpoint, lzma performed the best, lz4 performed the worst.</li>
<li>From a speed standpoint, zstd and lz4 are about tied for best speed, while lzma is the worst for speed.</li>
<li>lzo/lzop is certainly a bad choice - it approaches lzma in slowness while also making a file larger than gzip and almost as large as lz4. It’s the worst of all worlds combined.</li>
<li>xz is probably the most compelling as far as a balance between good speed and good compression - it’s almost as good as lzma as far as size, while being just a hair faster than gzip.</li>
<li>zstd is a bit of an improvement over gzip in size, while also being very very fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am of the opinion that xz is the best choice here based on this data, as our existing compression speed has been acceptable and shaving off 2-3 seconds per initramfs generation doesn’t seem that compelling except perhaps when doing ARM builds of Kicksecure on x86_64 hardware.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, people who know much more about compression tools under the hood than I do have complaints about design flaws in xz, which are documented <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/lzip/xz_inadequate.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>. I do not believe the issues mentioned in this article are of concern for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article primarily relates to xz’s suitability for long-term archival. Kernel initramfs files aren’t really something where “long-term archival” is a concern.</li>
<li>Most of the article focuses on xz’s lack of resiliency in the face of partial archive corruption. But we don’t care about this at all, we assume the initramfs is bit-for-bit identical to when it was created, and indeed in the future we will likely be signing the initramfs as part of Verified Boot (which will mandate that the initramfs be bit-for-bit idential to when it was created).</li>
<li>Other parts of the article focus on compatibility issues with different versions of xz. This also is not a concern - as long as dracut produces an initramfs that the Linux kernel can read and boot with, things are compatible enough for us.</li>
<li>The rest of the article appears to focus on various design decisions in xz that could have been made better. None of that is relevant for us though, since whatever feature set Dracut is using in xz is good enough to give it a very acceptable compression speed while also providing the second-smallest file size of any of the compression algorithms documented here. Even if xz could be better than it is, right now it’s better than everything else except maybe zstd if you really care about speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone else I saw did <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/Comparison_of_Compression_Algorithms" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">similar compression performance benchmarking</a> and concluded that <code>zstd</code> was the best general-purpose algorithm, though the data they present shows that parallel xz actually performed better than zstd’s best compression in both compression size and speed. One concerning thing this article does point out though is that xz can use a lot of RAM. For this reason, I tried generating a dracut initramfs using xz compression in a Kicksecure-CLI VirtualBox VM with only 512 MB RAM. Memory consumption during the initramfs generation rose to a maximum of 318M according to htop, and went down to 263M once the initramfs was generated, meaning that dracut and whatever tools it ran (including xz) used about 55M of memory during the generation process. Only about 1.97M of swap ended up used. This is much more than both gzip and zstd (which both only require about 5M of memory), but seems acceptable to me. 55M is not that much, especially given that <code>fwupd</code> is just sitting there eating 97M while doing basically nothing.</p>
<p>As a final note, I checked <a href="http://cve.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">cve.org</a> to see if security vulnerabilities were found in either the xz or zstd compressors in the Linux kernel. I found no vulnerabilities for either algorithm (using the search terms “linuz kernel xz” and “linux kernel zstd”).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe xz is the best compression method for us to use with dracut, due to its slightly better performance and much better compression compared to our current default, gzip. zstd is my second choice, and may be what we want to use if we have problems with xz’s speed or memory consumption.</p>

          <title>Separate (some) user applications from the operating system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Android, iOS, macOS, and Chrome OS all provide a level of separation between user-installed applications and the operating system. The operating system may provide certain applications to the user, but those applications are not installed by the user and generally cannot be uninstalled or replaced. User-controllable applications are separated from the rest of the system, and generally are sandboxed to prevent them from doing damage if they turn out to be malicious or become compromised.</p>
<p>Debian (and by extension, Kicksecure) doesn’t do this so well. All packages in the repositories are essentially operating system components, with full permissions to do anything the user account the application is launched as allows. Core components like udev and systemd are installed directly alongside productivity apps like image viewers and web browsers. This is a bit messy from the standpoint of system organization, but it also poses a significant security hazard for obvious reasons (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1200/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">XKCD 1200</a> sums up the issue nicely).</p>
<p>Users should be able to install arbitrary applications as OS components and give them elevated permissions, as they’ve always been able to do on Kicksecure and Whonix. But users should also be able to wall off applications into a sandbox of sorts if they don’t trust those applications or may have to process untrusted data with those applications.</p>
<p>Flatpak and Snap are relatively well-known attempts at bringing sandboxing and application isolation to Linux. Both of these are not exactly awesome solutions, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandboxing controls under Linux can be somewhat flimsy without putting a great deal of work into doing things like whitelisting syscalls and the like. In some instances, Linux’s sandboxing features actually worsen security (user namespaces in particular allow access to kernel facilities that aren’t usually available to unprivileged users, exposing additional attack surface; this has been the source of numerous CVEs, but user namespaces are also required by applications that do sandboxing internally, like Chromium).</li>
<li>Users can loosen sandboxing very easily with Flatpak, and without too much effort with Snap, defeating the purpose of the sandbox.</li>
<li>Flatpak and Snap sandboxing oftentimes causes application malfunctions due to restricting resources that applications legitimately need access to.</li>
<li>Applications from the Flathub repository and Snap Store can be uploaded by arbitrary users. This is in contrast to the Debian archive, which requires some level of skill and trust for a packager to gain upload access to it, and where policies help to ensure better packaging quality in general. As a result, Flatpaks and Snaps are oftentimes more broken than apt packages, and it is easy to upload malware to the repositories.
<ul>
<li>Malware actually has been uploaded to the Snap Store and has caused severe damage in the past, with at least one person <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">losing the equivalent of $490,000</a> after plugging in cryptocurrency recovery data into a malicious Exodus Wallet snap. This particular incident underscores the fact that sandboxing apps isn’t really enough, apps can still be malicious without having to break out of a sandbox at all. <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/03/exodus-wallet-part-three/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This same kind of attack happened on the Snap Store multiple times.</a> This is why getting apps from a trusted repository is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we really want is some sort of virtual machine that is integrated with the host <em>enough</em> to allow apps in the VM to feel native or close to native, but sufficiently walled off so that applications cannot do damage to the host system or escape the VM. This would allow running “user applications” in a very tight yet highly compatible sandbox, and would allow pulling those applications from trusted repositories like the Debian repos. It would also allow users to install applications without having to boot into a sysmaint session.</p>
<p>Chrome OS has something similar to this with <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/linux" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Crostini</a>, and Windows has something similar to this with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WSLg</a>. Something with a vaguely similar user experience would likely be acceptable, especially if an “app store” frontend of some sort was available so the user didn’t have to use a terminal to install sandboxed applications.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am reaching out to share some observations regarding missing panel items in the desktop settings for the two users (boot sessions), USER and USERMAINT. These issues were noticed while booting in Live Mode USB, and I believe it would be beneficial to me to provide my feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>USER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
The battery level indicator is absent from the system tray. This is particularly inconvenient for laptop users who rely on this feature to monitor their battery life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>USERMAINT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
Similar to USER, the battery level indicator is also missing.</li>
<li><em>Time Clock Item Missing</em><br>
The Time Clock item is absent from the panel, which is a useful feature for quick access to the current time.</li>
<li><em>Window Buttons Missing</em><br>
The absence of window indicators making it difficult to manage open windows. This has led to me to frustration while multitasking, such as when using the terminal to launch Firefox (look up issues) and Mousepad (take notes) and another xterm for debugging commands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Its good to leave the USERMAINT desktop minimal but the three above would not be too much to add to the panel.</p>

          <title>Set Mousepad to Launch in New Windows instead of Tabs by Default</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[desi_fubu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to share a minor suggestion regarding the default behavior of Mousepad, the text editor included in Xfce. While the default tabbed interface works well for many users, I personally find it a bit inconvenient or more like annoying. Hope this post doesn’t come across as annoying cause its nothing on Kicksecure but Xfce. Furthermore I suspect I’m not the only one who feels this way, especially for those of us who frequently switch between different desktop environments distro hopping and testing.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Mousepad could be configured by default within Kicksecure to open new instances in separate windows rather than tabs. This small change could greatly improve the user experience for those who prefer this behavior.</p>
<p>After some research, I discovered that this setting is managed via dconf (org) rather than a standard Xfce configuration file.</p>
<p>The following command can be used to set the desired behavior:</p>
<p><code>gsettings set org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window opening-mode 'window'</code></p>
<p>To make this change persistent across the system, you could create a drop-in dconf file. For example, you could add the following to a (example file <code>/etc/dconf/db/00_kicksecure-default-apps</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window]
opening-mode = 'window'
</code></pre>
<p>This would ensure that Mousepad opens new instances in separate windows by default. When I went to write notes on things inside of Live USB I couldn’t stand it making new tabs. This is what brought me here and I hope you give it a consideration.</p>

            <p>On my Dell Laptop it has a handy hardware WiFi Switch on the side that when switched/toggled it disables all Wireless (WWAN/WLAN/Bluetooth).</p>
<p>When booted from Live ISO (USB) on USER session or SYSMAINT session if I then go to toggle the WiFi switch to disable wireless at any given time it causes the system to permanently freeze. This is regardless if I connect to network first or not before toggling the switch.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Dell Laptops that are in the “Enterprise” category only come with these hardware style WiFi switches or these are just the ones that I have seen. I’m not sure about other brands but it’s nice for the obvious security reasons to disable wireless if you don’t need or are using wired Ethernet connection specifically as I’m doing.</p>
<p>Also why is <code>rfkill</code> not a included as a package or prepackages with the ISO?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>When installing Kicksecure, if you select to erase disk and unselect encryption the two password box but encrypt is still selected.<br>
If you press the tick mark again, the tick mark disappears, but you can’t press next, the button isn’t made clickable.</p>
<p>See more here:<br>
https ://streamable.com/p8jnkd</p>
<p>Doing manual disk partitioning is the only way I have found to get past without disk encryption.</p>
<p>This is happening for both a Hyper-V, VirtualBox and Physical PC installation.<br>
Selected language: English GB<br>
selected timezone: Copenhagen (Locale en-GB, formats DK)<br>

            <p>Helo,<br>
Kicksecure is installed on a rather old MAC.<br>
User- and Root (Sysmaint-) account have different passwords for login.<br>
I don’t know why but anyhow the password for sysmaint seems to be wrong, so I can’t login.   Access for user is still ok.<br>
Obviously editing Recovery Mode like in other distros is no longer possible as a precondition to set a new password.<br>
Is there another rather simple, direct way to reset the sysmaint password and set a new one?<br>
Thanks for help in advance.</p>

            <p>The last time i played around with veracrypt was back in January, so i know they worked on whatever version was back then. When i try to open a container vera asks for admin password. When i press enter the password window closes but the container is not opening.<br>
If i set up a password and enter it it says that the password is wrong.</p>
<p>I tried both the app image and installing it:<br>
sudo apt install dirmngr software-properties-common apt-transport-https curl lsb-release ca-certificates -y</p>
<p>curl -fsSL <a href="https://notesalexp.org/debian/alexp_key.asc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://notesalexp.org/debian/alexp_key.asc</a> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/alexp_key.gpg &gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>“start-mullvad-browser cannot be run using a symlink on this operating system”</p>
<p>How to reproduce this error on Kicksecure ?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install mullvad-browser using the official repository</li>
<li>Install the last version of firejail (0.9.74) deb package</li>
<li>Run : sudo firecfg</li>
<li>Run : firejail mullvad-browser</li>
</ol>
<p>I wonder if this error is coming from a hardening conf from Kicksecure or maybe the error is coming from firejail itself ? If the error is coming from firejail itself i’m sorry i will report this to them.</p>

          <title>Argon2 pbkdf setup and hardening in Kicksecure</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ketodiet100]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As of right now the time of writing the default LUKS Argon2id setup is 1GB (1048576 kb) for memory cost and the parallelism setting of 1-4 threads max.</p>
<p>These defaults were established to provide strong resistance to brute-force attacks by requiring significant computational resources, while capping parallelism to avoid excessive load on systems with limited cores. The memory cost ensures high RAM usage during key derivation, making GPU-based attacks more difficult, and the parallelism allows for multi-threaded processing up to 4 threads by default.</p>
<p>The iteration time is often set to around 2000 milliseconds, but memory and parallelism are the key parameters queried.</p>
<p>To verify these defaults you can use the <code>cryptsetup luksDump</code> command to inspect the current settings.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway others places have suggested and discussed that if a user has sufficient RAM they should increase it more then the default (1GB) manually.</p>
<p>Should Kicksecure use 1/2 or 1/3 of the total memory or have an option to in Graphical installer to set this?</p>
<p>I think the latter since having a option for advanced installs rather then an <em>“opt-in”</em> one size fits all approach. That would provide for flexibility and user by user use case when installing Kicksecure.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 available RAM example</li>
</ul>
<p><code>--pbkdf-memory $(awk -F ' ' '/MemTotal/ {printf "%.0f\n", $2 / 2}' /proc/meminfo)</code></p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 available RAM example</li>
</ul>
<p><code>--pbkdf-memory $(awk -F ' ' '/MemTotal/ {printf "%.0f\n", $2 / 3}' /proc/meminfo)</code></p>
<p>Typically or my understanding is that <code>cyrptsetup</code> will detect the max amount of threads available by the system and will use that when setting parallel defaults.<br>
Documenting how to upgrade a Luks Kicksecure install manually to increase the Argon2 memory cost might be worth mentioning.</p>

          <title>Kicksecure ISO Download Broken?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[desi_fubu]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Devs and Kicksecure Community,</p>
<p>I’m writing this post to bring to the attention that the Kicksecure ISO release 17.3.9.9 download appears to be broken.</p>
<p>This is how I got to this conclusion and the steps I took first.</p>
<p>First I downloaded it on Ubuntu via the Mullvad Browser and it made it to 1.0 GB then failed. So I remembered that Mullvad Browser uses their own DNS regardless if you have the Mullvad VPN or not. So I turned off their DOH settings and again it failed.</p>
<p>Then I freshly installed Firefox and again it fails at about 1.0 GB of the download. That made me think it was a Firefox thing, so next I tried with Brave Browser and same thing failed at the 1.0 GB mark. The ISO appears to slightly bigger then 1.0 GB. Mind you I checked my free space and despite having 173 GB of free space it failed so obliviously more then enough.</p>
<p>Next I tried downloading other Linux distro ISO’s and all of them fully downloaded. To test my next theory I switched/tried multiple DNS servers and again failed to download Kicksecure successfully.</p>
<p>Lastly I wanted to try another system to see if it was something I did so I booted up a Tails usb to download the Kicksecure ISO and again it failed despite me having more then enough RAM available (16GB).</p>
<p>This is really concerning cause in the past I downloaded one of the first Kicksecure ISO’s with no issue. My mind wants to go to the worst possible outcome, which I hope is not the case. Hopefully this is just a configuration issue on the server that hands out the downloads.</p>
<p>This needs to be looked into and investigated to see whats going on.</p>

            <p>Should Kicksecure stick with the default that Linux defaults to?</p>
<p><code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</code></p>
<p>The default range is 32768 - 60999<br>
I’m not sure why this reasoning and is the RFC-compliant recommended range outdated?</p>
<p>RFC-compliant ephemeral port range <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6335.html#section-6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">(RFC 6335)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private or Ephemeral Ports, from 49152-65535</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would changing the range to something Kicksecure specific increase Fingerprinting?</p>
<p><strong>Should it be increased to 65535?</strong> <code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    65535</code><br>
Increased entropy equals better protection against port prediction?<br>
More ports equals less chance of port collisions under high loads?<br>
Does changing it increase attack surface?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this since Kicksecure is also a consideration for server use?</p>

            <p>I studied all popular secure messengers and found that only Simplex provides not only high anonymity but also high protection (encrypted local storage and  self-destruct passcode). This is great for Kicksecure. I think you can copy this page to the Kicksecure wiki <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SimpleX" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SimpleX</a> and add Simplex and Session <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Session" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Use Session Session Private Messenger Chat with Kicksecure ™</a> to section of recommended messengers <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Software#Instant_Messengers" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Software Recommendations</a></p>
<p>Or I can add links to the websites of these messengers in the wiki:<br>

          <title>Persistent GRUB Boot Issue with Kicksecure and Multiple SSDs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[g4a3qo6p]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I initially installed Kicksecure on an SSD in my PC and used it without any issues. After shutting down my PC and removing that SSD, I installed a different Linux distribution on another SSD, which also worked perfectly. However, when I turned off my PC and attempted to boot back into Kicksecure, it only loaded into GRUB, necessitating a reinstallation of GRUB on the Kicksecure installation. This problem recurs every time I boot into another operating system, forcing me to reinstall GRUB to use Kicksecure again.</p>
<p>How can I resolve this issue to avoid repeatedly reinstalling GRUB to use Kicksecure, while still being able to use other operating systems from different SSDs on my PC? Could this issue be related to my BIOS settings, and if so, what specific settings should I check or modify in the BIOS to fix it?</p>

          <title>KickSecure Qubes Template Questions And sysmaint Account</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[fevivav425]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I formerly manually installed KickSecure into Qubes Debian template a few years back and recently installed the independent KickSecure template but was completely caught off guard by the introduction of the highly restrictive user-sysmaint-split feature which prevents the use of sudo and installing software from/in the default user account etc.</p>
<p>I feel the impact to the user experience of this new feature could have been made far bolder/more apparent (rather than just a simple new feature introduction reference) but i do acknowledge the solid reasoning behind the introduction of this important security feature and would still like to give it a go rather than simply bypassing/removing it.</p>
<p>I browsed some info regarding this new feature and understand one must reboot into (rather than simply log out of the current account and straight into) the sysmaint account to install software and make changes etc but am interested to know the recommended way to reboot into this account in a Qubes template given there is no UI shown during the normal boot up process. Please advise.</p>
<p>I also note that during the first steps of template installation instructions it enables the repo “qubes-templates-community-testing” and assume this essentially enables the same option as the “community testing templates” tick box in the Qubes OS Global Config UI menu. Strangely this option still remains unticked in this UI after running the Dom0 terminal command and also even after a restart. Shouldn’t this option now be automatically ticked in the UI after this change using the terminal?</p>
<p>I largely try and avoid enabling testing repos to prevent potentially installing Beta/RC updates which can have stability and other issues at times. Now that KickSecure is installed can i safely disable the “qubes-templates-community-testing” repo or will this potentially prevent/delay KickSecure from receiving important updates? If it must be enabled, is there any way to limit this repo to just KickSecure only and ensure it isn’t available to any of my other VM’s?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and advice.</p>

          <title>Outbound traffic security: Kicksecure and Qubes</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[FreshStar]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>After my previous question about Kicksecure outgoing traffic was answered, I have a further relevant follow-up question.</p>
<p>When trying to compare <strong>Kicksecure Host</strong> to <strong>Qubes Hypervisor  with Whonix</strong>: Is Qubes more secure and reliable regarding avoiding outgoing clearnet traffic, because Tor is <strong>technically enforced</strong> for all outgoing traffic via settings, i.e. there’s always Whonix-Gateway (proxy) in between which acts like a kill switch? From my understanding this is not the case in Kicksecure.</p>
