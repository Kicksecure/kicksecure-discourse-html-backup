          <title>3 big issues in Kicksecure 18 (my laptop is basically unusable now)</title>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>I cannot run swaylock. I am using a gb keyboard layout (kinda, I will explain after) and have swaylock installed. When trying to install from the system maintenance panel, it said “Refusing to lock screen, because the correct screen locker cannot be determined. The XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable must be set to ‘x11’ or ‘wayland’ to determine the proper screen locker to use. However, XDG_SESSION_TYPE is currently set to ‘tty’. Please report this bug!“ I ran “XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland”. Still doesn’t work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reason why I say I am kinda on gb is because I set gb in the install and it worked originally, but I think that after changing to kwin, it went to US, my /etc/vconsole.conf says gb, but it is still US.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what is said when I did the keyboard config option in configuration center and keyboard layout.<br>
00:00:00.000 [../src/main.c:72] LABWC_PID not set<br>
set_labwc_keymap: WARNING: ‘labwc --reconfigure’ reconfiguration failed!<br>
set_labwc_keymap: INFO: new ‘/home/user/.config/labwc/environment’ contents:<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=gb<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=<br>
set_labwc_keymap: INFO: Configuration success.</p>
<p>Btw, the reason I changed to kwin instead of labwc, is because I really like having workspaces, but I couldn’t have workspaces without it. When I put desktop switcher in my pannel it shows “n/a”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>My trackpad isn’t working. I have no idea if this is because of kicksecure 18, but randomly it just stopped working, I was configuring kicksecure fine and my trackpad was working. (At this point swaylock worked) I went to do something, and when I came back it said someething along the lines of screenlock broken, go to terminal with ctrl+shift+f2. I shutdown, and after turning it on, my mouse didn’t move. I tried to reflash kicksecure and it still didn’t work, even during the install process and after too. I have been using a mouse plugged into my laptop. But I am sharing with my PC, this is really annoying.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would really appreciate some support, I can barely use my laptop right now. If I can go back to xfce, that would also work. Thanks.</p>
</li>
</ol>

            <p>Hey all, nooby question (eventually <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face.png?v=14" title=":grinning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) so apologies if I’ve asked wrong.</p>
<p>Been trying to morph K18 on Trixie usb. Failed 4-5 times so far. Having fun though and learning stuff <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face.png?v=14" title=":grinning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Tried two different fast 1tb usbs, one with lvm encryption and one just lvm, no encryption. Used rufus and etcher.</p>
<p>Trixie installs every time with just lxqt and Debian desktop environment. I follow the guide add the repo manually as not in extrepo for Trixie, then I run into issues once I reboot after installing K18.</p>
<p>On first usb (A) bugs out after entering encryption password, asks for user login then fails to load lxqt and returns cli - don’t know how to start lxqt from cli. Or I run into lux swap file issue and no cli and no options. On second usb (B) K18 install failed as it couldn’t install security-misc and reported process error. Cli option to fix doesn’t fix. When I reboot it’s just into Trixie.</p>
<p>I’m trying to discount my Trixie install choices as a factor.</p>
<p>Question = Are there any dos/dont on the Trixie install which will screw up the k18 morph?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and any tips.</p>

i want to report a problem and provide resolution for future folks to save their time and help people abroad as many people as possible to this system.</p>
<p>problem was that i had no sound after switching from Debian 13 to Kicksecure 18:</p>
<p>1)‘cat /proc/asound/cards’ outputs ‘— no soundcards —’</p>
<p>2)‘lspci -k -nn’ outputs correctly my audio card which is:<br>

<p>3)sudo journalctl -b &gt; output.txt - reports error with not loading “sof-firmware” package</p>

          <title>Some default apps in K18 just can&#39;t work</title>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I’m a happy user of Kicksecure 17, but since major release 18 is out I feel a bit frustrated as some things that worked before simply don’t anymore.</p>
<p>Give you a couple of examples:</p>
<p>The system tools GParted and GSmartControl can’t work any more due to the higher privileges required.</p>
<p>Even after removing sysmaint account they don’t work. I do understand it’s related to privleap and Wayland, but unfortunately I am not skilled enough to find a way to ‘fix’ this.</p>
<p>I’m really concerned as my threat model also implies I use KVM in live mode host and ZuluCrypt, where both required higher privileges.</p>
<p>Any suggestion to make all these apps with higher privileges to work?</p>

<p>is <code>kicksecure-qubes-server</code> required after the installation is done?<br>
I used <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-qubes-server</code> and after completion - <code>sudo apt purge tor -y</code> and it deleted the <code>kicksecure-qubes-server</code></p>
<p>please clarify. I don’t recall the same behavior with <code>cli</code>package on prev version</p>

          <title>Sdwdate broken after upgrade to Kicksecure 18: Missing SECCOMP syscalls (statx, fstatfs, epoll_pwait2)</title>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>After upgrading from Kicksecure 17 to 18 I noticed that <code>sdwdate</code> never finished syncing time. After checking the logs I found several lines similar to this,</p>
<p><code>SECCOMP auid=4294967295 uid=117 gid=130 ses=4294967295 subj=unconfined pid=6319 comm=“leaprun” exe=“/usr/bin/python3.13” sig=31 arch=c000003e syscall=332 compat=0 ip=0x7c87efbaf31a code=0x80000000</code></p>
<p>By following the instructions on <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Seccomp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Debugging Systemd Seccomp</a>, I figure out that syscalls 332 (statx), 138 (fstatfs) and 441 (epoll_pwait2) needed to be added to <code>SystemCallFilter=</code>. And indeed after doing that the issue was completely fixed. Architecture is x86_64.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is not the correct category, I wasn’t sure if I should post this on Support or Development.</p>

            <p>The question goes for whonix 17 also, but to put it mildly 18 needs a bit of polishing, the main thing is that i need copy paste and with the wayland bug on virtualbox I aint getting that. Also for some reason KVM slows down my machine to a craw.<br>
So the question is for how long will the 17.4.4.6 versions of whonix and kick be safe to use?</p>

          <title>Research into Wiping video RAM (VRAM) on shutdown</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Tengu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>While browsing the grub‑live wiki I discovered that neither grub‑live nor Tails clears VRAM when the system shuts down.</p>
<p>When the system powers down, the kernel stops the CPUs and tells each driver to simply hand the device back to the firmware. The firmware may or may not clear the memory when power is removed. Complete loss of power guarantees erasure usually right?</p>
<p>With the nohibernate flag now in play, could this interfere with reaching the deepest D3 cold power state? I’m no computer scientist, but my intuition says there shouldn’t be a direct link.<br>
Has anyone published research on this topic? Is a reliable feature even feasible for Kicksecure?</p>
<p>How could you turn the GPU off before the CPU?</p>
<p>Does an already normal linux shutdown put devices in D3 cold?</p>
<p>For context, I’ve been looking at kernel GPU parameters and both AMD and Radeon expose runtime power management flags that let the GPU request D3 Cold.</p>
<p>Building on a previous discussion about dracut and grub‑live, I’m wondering whether we can leverage <code>rd.driver.pre=</code> and <code>rd.driver.post=</code> to force the amdgpu module to load inside the initramfs before the real root mounts. Then keep that module loaded after the real root is mounted so it is still present when the dracut‑shutdown stage runs? I’d presume that it wouldn’t be as simple as just this alone. Something like the ram-wipe Dracut module?</p>

          <title>Switch LXQT compositor/labwc settings?</title>

            <p>Hi, new Kicksecure user here. Before I continue, I want to say, thank you so much for this distro. This is amazing. This distro let me get what would have been weeks of work and plenty of holes from my knowledge gaps solved with a simple gui install. Between GrapheneOS and this, it’s amazing that we have tools that make some level of security <em>easy.</em></p>
<p>I’m fairly used to a traditional Linux desktop, where I have a window manager setup. Personally I would have loved if Kicksecure would provide a cli version to install on metal, but it seems the only option for that is morphing debian, which is not really what I want to do. I understand this is a low priority for most users, and obviously, the focus of this is security, not customization. That said, given this is LXQT, is there a way to access the settings of labwc and/or change the compositor to Sway (for tiling)? Some of my keyboard buttons (volume, most importantly)are not working, and I would like to add some keyboard shortcuts, but on Wayland, this needs to be done through the compositor, not LXQT. I couldn’t see any GUI settings for this, but I was pretty sure they existed (granted it has been a while since I last used LXQT). Have these been hidden for a security reason, or am I misremembering? Is there any way to change these safely?</p>

          <title>3D acceleration for Kicksecure VMs</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Creating this so I have something to reference for documentation on the wiki.</p>
<p>While attempting to update the glmark2 instructions for Kicksecure 18, I discovered that 3d acceleration under VirtualBox is a mess, at least when using VMSVGA graphics. So far:</p>
<ul>
<li>With 3d accel disabled, everything <em>seems</em> OK, glmark2-wayland runs without problems, but naturally it uses the CPU for everything.</li>
<li>With 3d accel enabled, glmark2-wayland still uses CPU rendering by default, because labwc is started with <code>WLR_RENDERER=pixman</code> set by default. One has to unset this environment variable before starting labwc to get 3d acceleration capabilities to be recognized. Technically this is a Kicksecure limitation that could be fixed.</li>
<li>If you are running with low memory (in my case 768 MB, I had left the VM with this amount of memory on accident), 3d accel is enabled, and glmark2-wayland is <strong>NOT</strong> using 3d accel (i.e. <code>WLR_RENDERER=pixman</code> is set), the VM will spontaneously hang or reboot during the glmark2-wayland test. This is because something (didn’t have the presence of mind to record what) in the kernel ends up doing the equivalent of a segfault, which results in a kernel oops, which results in a kernel panic, which results in an instant reboot..</li>
<li>If you attempt to run glmark2 (just plain glmark2, which will go through Xwayland) without using CPU rendering (<code>WLR_RENDERER=pixman</code>), the glmark2 window will briefly flash on-screen and then vanish.</li>
<li>If you attempt to run glmark2 (the X11 version) with GPU rendering (<code>WLR_RENDERER</code> unset when labwc is started), it will immediately crash <em>labwc itself</em> when launched.</li>
<li>If you attempt to run glmark2-wayland with GPU rendering (<code>WLR_RENDERER</code> unset when labwc is started), it will immediately error out:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">=======================================================
    glmark2 2023.01
=======================================================
    OpenGL Information
    GL_VENDOR:      VMware, Inc.
    GL_RENDERER:    SVGA3D; build: RELEASE;  LLVM;

=======================================================
</code></pre>
<p>At this point I’m pretty sure 3d rendering in VirtualBox is just broken. It might work better if using VBoxSVGA graphics, but as I understand it, the 3d acceleration code for that graphics emulator is insecure and can be used for a VM escape.</p>

            <p>Hello Kicksecure,</p>
<p>Been a long time lurker since I started using whonix and really like debian and all that jazz.</p>
<p>So my question is whats the difference between grub live and a custom grub entry with <code>toram noswap nohibernate</code> flags?</p>
<p>Whats different with “grub live” or makes it different from a custom entry that has <code>toram noswap nohibernate</code> chosen and passed after selecting it in the bootloader?</p>
<p>Previously I installed grub-live on debian through the Kicksecure repo in the past out of curiosity it said I had swap enabled still which also confuses it me? That was like many months ago so I’m sure things have changed?</p>
<p>Is it some kind of compression swap like overlay like zram?</p>

            <p>The ability of passing information from user session to sysmaint session can be used maliciously.</p>
<p>Scenario in my head is that the NetworkManager if configured under user session the same info will be passed to sysmaint, what if the info passed will not be x.x.x.x IP but instead sudo 123?</p>
<p>So user/s sessions shall not pass information of their changes to sysmaint to avoid such scenario.</p>

            <p>I installed kicksecure on a portable SSD along with linux mint, grub kicksecure boots by default and sees mint.<br>
Moved the SSD to a second computer and it does not see grub kicksecure, but sees grub mint. Why is this happening? Is there an easy way to fix this?<br>
sudo os-prober in mint does not find kicksecure.</p>
<p>Do I have to boot into a live iso system, mount the kicksecure partition there and in chroot mode do this command?<br>
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sdX -p Y -L ‘Kicksecure’ -l ‘EFI\Kicksecure\shimx64.efi’</p>
<p>Is there no other way?</p>

          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I installed the kicksecure 18 iso on an old laptop and wanted to lock the screen when the lid closes.</p>
<p>At first I received this warning message:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="plaintext"><code class="lang-plaintext">Refusing to lock screen, because current account 'user' has no password set.
If the screen was locked, it would automatically unlock the moment any user input was received. Please set a password to enable screen locking.
</code></pre>
<p>So I creating a password &amp; disabled auto-login for “user” in sysmaint.<br>
Now I can now lock the screen as “user”, but no matter what I type into sway lock I’m told the password in wrong.</p>
<p>I tried changing the “user” password to a single numerical digit in case it’s some sort of keyboard layout issue, but that didn’t work either.</p>
<p>Then I tried removing the “user“ password, re-enabled auto-login and manually ran the sway lock command from <code>/usr/bin/lock-screen</code> in qterminal:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code class="lang-bash">swaylock --color 000000 --image /usr/share/kicksecure/lock-screen-background.png --scaling fit
</code></pre>
<p>That brings up sway lock, but no matter what I type it still won’t unlock (contrary to the prior warning message)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Qubes R4.2:</strong> <strong>Kicksecure 18 unavailable.</strong> Kicksecure 18 won’t be available for Qubes R4.2.
<ul>
<li><strong>Release status:</strong> Even though Qubes R4.3 is only available as a <strong>r</strong>elease <strong>c</strong>andidate (RC) at the time of writing,</li>
<li><strong>Expected release:</strong> A stable release of Qubes R4.3 (and Kicksecure 18) is probably not far away.</li>
<li><strong>Upgrade recommendation:</strong> Kicksecure 17 users on Qubes R4.2 are encouraged to consider upgrading to Kicksecure 18 on Qubes R4.3 as soon as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Maintenance situation:</strong> Kicksecure 18 is what developers are using and where the development focus is. It comes with much newer packages. Kicksecure is a small project and does not have a dedicated team for oldstable support. Therefore, oldstable support is maintained as a side project. More details: <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10219">decide availability of Kicksecure and Whonix 18 (Debian trixie based) on Qubes R4.2 versus R4.3 #10219</a></li>

<li><strong>Qubes R4.3:</strong> Kicksecure 18 is available.</li>

The unit files have no installation config (WantedBy=, RequiredBy=, UpheldBy=, Also=, or Alias= settings in the [Install] section, and DefaultInstance= for template units). This means they are not meant to be enabled or disabled using systemctl. Possible reasons for having these kinds of units are:
* A unit may be statically enabled by being symlinked from another unit's .wants/, .requires/, or .upholds/ directory.
* A unit's purpose may be to act as a helper for some other unit which has a requirement dependency on it.
* A unit may be started when needed via activation (socket, path, timer, D-Bus, udev, scripted systemctl call, ...).
* In case of template units, the unit is meant to be enabled with some instance name specified.

            <p>I was following along on the kicksecure ram-wipe documentation for installing. and at the end it says:<br>
<em><strong>To wipe the LUKS full disk encryption (FDE) for the root disk from RAM it is required to unmount and root disk file system and close the root disk LUKS volume during the shutdown process.</strong></em></p>
<p>And thats where my issues arise. I installed the ram-wipe package to a Kali Linux VM, and the script works on shutdown. However it complains that there are still mounted encrypted disks.</p>
<p>How can you make it so that LUKS volumes get unmounted on shutdown so that ram wipe can do it’s thing?</p>

###<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> Qubes OS release

R4.3

### Brief summary

Some of the resolutions advertised to HVMs by the VGA emulation aren't supported by the VGA emulation itself. One of those resolutions is 1366x768, which if actually set will result in a badly distorted flashy mess. This happens in arbitrary Linux distributions regardless of display server (X or Wayland) to my awareness; I can reproduce the issue on openSUSE Tumbleweed (both XFCE and GNOME) and Kicksecure 18. All show 1366x768 as available; Kicksecure and openSUSE Tumbleweed XFCE show distortion when set to these resolutions, while openSUSE Tumbleweed GNOME ends up set to 1360x768 when 1366x768 is requested.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Download an OpenSUSE live image from https://get.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/?type=desktop#download, which image doesn't matter.
2. Create a new HVM, set its memory to 4000/4000 MB, and disable memory balancing.
3. Boot the HVM from the downloaded ISO.
4. Look at the display resolution settings. 1366x768 will be advertised.
5. Set the resolution to 1366x768.

### Expected behavior

1366x768 either should not be advertised, or should work properly.

### Actual behavior

1366x768 is recognized, and when set it results in either a badly distorted, unusable display, or a slightly smaller display than expected.

### Additional information

This issue does not occur with QEMU 10.1.2 build from source on Kubuntu 24.04 (the 1366x768 display mode isn't advertised at all). Thus if this is a QEMU bug, it's probably fixed upstream already.</span></p>

###<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> The problem you're addressing (if any)

The default quantity of VRAM available for HVMs (I believe 16 MB) is insufficient to support 1920x1080 with some display servers (notably labwc). Attempting to set this resolution will succeed, but the display server will lock up and spam memory allocation errors to the system log. Increasing video RAM to 64 MB fixes the issue, at the cost of increasing RAM consumption. This increased RAM consumption makes increasing the video RAM for all VMs on Qubes an undesirable solution, so the user should be able to customize the quantity of video RAM themselves. While technically this is doable already, it has to be done by creating a Jinja template for libvirt XML, as documented at https://dev.qubes-os.org/projects/core-admin/en/latest/libvirt.html. This is not easy for a user to do.

### The solution you'd like

Provide a new qvm-feature, `video-ram` or similar, that allows setting the amount of RAM allocated to the emulated VGA card in megabytes, similar to the `vgamem_mb` setting in QEMU.

### The value to a user and who that user might be

Users can take advantage of high VM display resolutions when using HVMs, without having to create a Jinja template.

### Completion criteria checklist

* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10424

### The solution you'd like

Support `virtio` graphic driver inside HVM or other modern virtual graphic device / driver.

### The value to a user and who that user might be

More compatible Qubes HVM and less failed boots for users such as black screen during boot.

### Additional information

Quote @arraybolt3 

&gt; @marmarek: Is there any way to pass custom parameters to the QEMU instance that HVMs run in? Not sure why we didn't run into this before, maybe it's kernel related, but it looks like labwc really, really hates the default VGA graphics that Qubes OS provides to VGA-enabled HVMs. This isn't Qubes-specific, I've seen the same behavior under QEMU/KVM on Kubuntu 24.04 also. I know that virtio graphics work, and would like to switch to those.

Quote @marmarek 

&gt; see qvm-features -&gt; video-model

Quote @arraybolt3

&gt; (the specific behavior is that labwc initially works, then freezes, and spams a lot of errors stating `connector Virtual-1: Atomic commit failed: Cannot allocate memory`

Quote @marmarek:

&gt; that said, I'm not sure if virtio will work here, but I guess you can try... but there are also other possible options

Quote @marmarek:

&gt; doesn't seem to have virtio support, but qxl is there, so maybe that will be enough.

Quote @arraybolt3:

&gt; sadly it looks like the only option supported other than the default vga or xen (which appears to be a synonym for vga) is cirrus, which does actually work but also has a max resolution of 1360x768. [...]

&gt; So it turns out that the issue is almost certainly that we now have code that resizes the window to 1920x1080 during bootup. labwc works just fine as 1024x768, and a few higher resolutions, but 1366x768 results in a horribly distorted display, 1600x900 did even weirder things, and 1920x1080 results in labwc freezing.

&gt; AFAICT the video-model option is just telling Xen what VGA hardware it should emulate, rather than using QEMU to do that part. Is there any way in which Qubes OS could use QEMU for graphics emulation instead, so that things like virtio would be available?

Quote @marmarek

&gt; Xen doesn't do any emulation, it's all in QEMU, and this option translates to QEMU cmdline. There is libvirt in between, which affects what options are supported. But as said before, even if virtio would be on the list, I doubt it would work with Xen...

&gt; Another thing is also vram attribute in libvirt xml, it defaults to 16MB, maybe that needs increasing? But for that we don't have qvm-features, it would need https://dev.qubes-os.org/projects/core-admin/en/latest/libvirt.html

            <p>Hello. I have read an article from the anarsec guide about best practices using Tails. It recommends to use a write protect switch. It mentions two methods (using a USB drive with a write-protect switch and using a mircoSD card) that relies either on a proprietary hardware, or on a method that is not secure (SD card write protect switch asks for a protection but does not physically prevent writing on the disk).</p>
<p>But the article mention one way that could provide a provably secure operating system : Load the OS into RAM. The idea would be to boot the ISO on, load it into RAM, unplug the drive, and then start browsing the internet and maybe expose to viruses and malwares. <strong>My proposition is to add an option to load Kicksecure/Whonix Host into RAM with a graphical interface.</strong><br>
Sorry for my grammar, English is not my native language.</p>
<p><em>P.S. : I know that compromising the Kicksecure/Whonix source code would make this protection futile, but three-letters-agency-secret-supply-chain-attacks-operations aside this would allow a nearly invulnerable system against virus persistence.</em></p>
