            <p>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?</p>
<p>At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.</p>
<p>I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So I’m totally new to Kicksucure. I want to try it out and play around with it in a VM using Virt manager using Mint as the host OS. That way I can get a feel for it and download my apps.</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to figure out how to set a persistant VM though! Whenever I shutdown that VM then try to open it I get a black screen saying no bootable device found and have to delete and then spin up the VM again.</p>
<p>I have tried booting from a USB and still can’t figure out how to set a persistant mode. I would kinda like to use kicksecure as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Article “Non Anonymous Onion Encryption and NAT Traversal” mentioned building Tor software with Tor2Web mode but this build option has been removed by Tor Project a long time ago (since 0.3.5.1-alpha in 2018):</p>
<p><code>https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/maint-0.3.5/ChangeLog#L888</code></p>
<p>I don’t know how to update this article because I don’t understand how to change this. Does having to jump through 4 hops instead of 6 still delivers the purpose of being faster/lower latency NAT traversal? Or is it preferred we remove this article as a whole?</p>

<p>I really love Kicksecure and Whonix, so thank you to all for providing this.</p>
<p>I was thinking of distromorphing kicksecure for a metal install and wanted to avoid systemd. As many researchers agree that it can be a  security issue.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to distromorph from Devuan?<br>
How many packages would need to be changed that rely on systemd?</p>

          <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>

          <title>Request and Idea for including a tmpfs-setup package?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0x506c61746f]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This idea was inspired by this users post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-regarding-use-of-tmpfs-formatting-and-conflicts/1057" class="inline-onebox">Questions regarding use of tmpfs formatting and conflicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summery of idea in a nutshell is basically to make the package set /tmp mount point to tmpfs and add a <code>/etc/profile.d/</code> drop in to set the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache</code> variable for all users shell.</p>
<h2><a name="p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1"></a>Idea for /etc/profile.d/xdg-cache.sh</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh

## Set XDG_CACHE_HOME to a per-user cache directory.
#   Prefer a private sub-directory under /tmp when /tmp is a tmpfs.
#   Fall back to ${HOME}/.cache if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
#
## Detect whether /tmp is a mount point (i.e. a separate filesystem).
#    On most modern distros this will be a tmpfs, but on some it may
#    be a regular disk partition.
if grep -q "^tmpfs.*/tmp.*tmpfs" /proc/mounts || mountpoint -q /tmp; then

    # /tmp is a mount point - assume it is a tmpfs.
    BASE_ROOT="/tmp/${USER}"
else
    # /tmp is part of the root filesystem (disk based).
    # Use the traditional default users /home based cache location instead.
    BASE_ROOT="${HOME}"
fi

## Build the final cache directory path.
#    We always put the cache in a ".cache" sub-folder so that tools
#    that follow the XDG spec find what they expect.
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_ROOT}/.cache"

## Ensure the directory exists and is private to the user.
#    /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), so we must create a
#    private subtree and lock it down with chmod 700.
#
# Create the parent directory (only needed when we are using /tmp)
if [ "${BASE_ROOT}" != "${HOME}" ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -d "${BASE_ROOT}" ]; then
    mkdir -p "${BASE_ROOT}"
    chmod 700 "${BASE_ROOT}"          
fi

# Now create the .cache directory itself
mkdir -p "${CACHE_DIR}"
chmod 700 "${CACHE_DIR}"

## Export the variable so the rest of the session sees it.
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${CACHE_DIR}"
</code></pre>
<p>For the above To make it more bullet‑proof, you could tighten the /tmp detection for the <code>export XDG_CAHCE_HOME="/tmp/${USER}/.cache</code> creation</p>
<p>Systemd can generate a tmpfs mount for /tmp via the tmp.mount unit, but that unit is optional and can be disabled.<br>
In live environments, the initramfs (often via dracut in Kicksecure case) typically mounts tmpfs at /tmp automatically.<br>
Either the package should detect this and not interfere. otherwise a more robust way would be to ship <code>/etc/fstab</code> to be mounted to tmpfs by enabling and masking the builtin systemd unit, completely bypassing the need to fiddle with /etc/fstab. This is via enabling systemd’s tmp.mount unless it interferes with grub-live?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Would this be a good idea to implement or do you think its a waste of time since grub-live “Live Mode” already exists and it could complicate its implementation or conflict with it with complexity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fedoraproject . org/wiki/Features/tmp-on-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solaris has been doing this since 1994. (Much like other Unixes, too.) Debian’s next release defaults to tmpfs on /tmp, too. ArchLinux defaults to this as well. Ubuntu has plans for their 12.10 release.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>www . debian. org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From trixie, the default is for the /tmp/ directory to be stored in memory using a tmpfs(5) filesystem. This should make applications using temporary files faster, but if you put large files there, you may run out of memory.</p>

          <title>Chvt - change foreground virtual terminal (VT) (tty) - prevent malware from forced tty change</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Issue:</p>
<p>Malware could switch to another tty but can’t attempt to log in there or feed any data. Malware could pull the user from an emergency session tty back to the original graphical session where the malware runs.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>login into a tty3 - ideally as root</li>
<li><code>chvt 3 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; chvt 2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This also works which is a bit scary. So chvt can even boss around root.</p>
<p>This forced terminal change is something I’d like to fix.</p>
<p>Non-solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Require sudo”: chvt does not require sudo/root.</li>
<li>“Set chvt noSUID”: chvt is already non-suid.</li>
<li>“Delete chvt”: chvt is a user-space utility. Malware could ship the same tool or malware could run the same syscall. Deleting chvt therefore does not accomplish very much.</li>
<li><code>/etc/security/access.con</code> Is only PAM configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real solution:</p>
<p>The only solution is a proper system configuration.</p>

            <p>Kicksecure initates Tor connections by default to check for updates and download updates etc.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous to have Kicksecure active 24/7 even when not using it actively as state actors could potentially correlate connection patterns to deanonymize you?</p>
<p>Or is it even more dangerous to shutdown your Kicksecure device when not actively using it as they could correlate your Tor connections with your real life patterns, e.g. you shut down Kicksecure when leaving your physical location with your personal mobile device which is linked to your identity?</p>
<p>I am aware of this is an anoymity question and this is not a target of Kicksecure but related to Kicksecure.</p>

This would allow the device to attack arbitrary services with open ports on the host. A firewall would help here (maybe, depends on whether it blocked the LAN or not), but what might help even more is if NetworkManager didn’t automatically connect the system to any wired network interfaces it sees.</p>
<p>Would it be desirable to turn off this wired autoconnect feature by default? Users could still use wired networks, they would just have to explicitly connect to them using the network management widget.</p>

          <title>Systemd Service Hardening?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was learning about the options for Systemd services for restricting or in another word “hardening” services.</p>
<p>This made me question does Kicksecure deploy certain hardening for it’s services or certain Kicksecure specific services?</p>
<p>These are some interesting options I will note here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateNetwork=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives the service its own network namespace. It can’t see or use the host’s network interfaces unless you explicitly bind sockets. Seems useful to prevent leaks or prevent services from being ran without networking?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivatePIDs=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivatePIDs=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives a service an isolated view of the process table, which is a useful “defense in depth” measure, especially for daemons that don’t need to inspect or manage other system processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateTmp=yes/no</code></a><br>
Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp for the service, isolating it from the host’s temporary directories. One service can’t read temporary files left by another service, which mitigates attacks that rely on guessing or stealing temp‑file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#MemoryDenyWriteExecute=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes/no</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service. (helps mitigate code‑injection attacks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>ProtectSystem=full/strict/yes</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service.</p>
<p>There is many others but these few caught my eye.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One problem is that when you dual or multiboot, even if you are using encryption on your Qubes installation, /boot is still unprotected and could be maliciously modified by the other OS, possibly leading to Qubes itself being maliciously modified.</p>
<p>The other problem is firmware security - for example the other system could infect the BIOS firmware, which might enable compromise or spying on the Qubes system.</p>

          <title>USBGuard - what should we allow or disallow by default?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Kicksecure 18 is intended to ship USBGuard by default, with a configuration that should block likely-malicious, unknown, and unusual devices. The hope is that it won’t block so much as to significantly increase the difficulty of using Kicksecure, while also making it more difficult to use devices such as the Hak5 rubber ducky or O.MG plug (popular keystroke injection devices).</p>
<p>Our current USBGuard configuration is visible at <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">security-misc/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf at master · Kicksecure/security-misc · GitHub</a>. The original intent was to allow everything connected at boot, and then disallow everything other than mass storage devices, keyboards, and mice, while also not allowing keyboards or mice to be combined with other interfaces, and not allowing additional keyboards and mice to be attached if one is already present. However, as pointed out by Marek (the lead Qubes OS developer), this is going to cause <em>tons</em> of legitimate devices to be blocked: <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/commit/cba16879eff9d3d998c127e41c38d2067cdf04cc#r164474977" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Polish USBGuard configuration · Kicksecure/security-misc@cba1687 · GitHub</a></p>
<p>We have a pretty classic security vs. usability tradeoff here. We don’t want to block so much that users disable USBGuard because they can’t live with it, but we also don’t want to allow so much that malicious devices work in common configurations. It’s already risky enough allowing keyboards and mice to be attached after bootup, since if the only keyboard and mouse present on bootup is non-USB (as is the case with most laptops if you don’t plug additional devices into them), keystroke injection devices that present themselves as only a keyboard will be able to attack the system and succeed. But blocking <em>everything</em> other than keyboards, mice, and storage devices may be overkill also.</p>
<p>Does anyone have input on what should be blocked or not blocked by default? Some USB devices to think about here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcams
<ul>
<li>On its own, a webcam probably can’t cause too much trouble… the worst it could do is video the user on the user’s own machine, it would probably be much more useful for an attacker to record the user with an <em>attacker-controlled</em> machine, which of course USBGuard can’t do anything about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microphones
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headsets/speakers/miscellaneous other USB audio devices
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>Could introduce attack surface that we don’t want, see <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part I</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MIDI interfaces
<ul>
<li>Probably pretty rare, no idea what the risks are of allowing these to be used by default, would probably block them just in case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreens
<ul>
<li>Input device, similar to a mouse, might even be handled already by allowing mice in the system. Dangers are similar or identical to allowing mice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android devices
<ul>
<li>Uses or at least used to use Media Transfer Protocol. Unsure what the risks are here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USB Ethernet
<ul>
<li>Oftentimes uses RNDIS, which the Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman has tried to get disabled in Linux at least <em>three times</em> due to supposedly unfixable security issues. (<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024</a>) I would consider this very high-risk and would NOT enable it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bluetooth dongles
<ul>
<li>Could be used to attach arbitrary devices to systems remotely, but this would require some user interaction. Unsure what the implications of a malicious Bluetooth dongle would be. Internal Bluetooth cards actually use the USB bus, but they’ll be present on boot and thus allowed, if everything works as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2FA keys
<ul>
<li>I believe these present themselves as a human interface device, not sure how safe or unsafe this is or if it’s feasible to allow it by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else we should consider allowing or not allowing by default?</li>
