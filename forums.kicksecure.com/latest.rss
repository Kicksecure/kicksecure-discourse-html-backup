          <title>Separate (some) user applications from the operating system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Android, iOS, macOS, and Chrome OS all provide a level of separation between user-installed applications and the operating system. The operating system may provide certain applications to the user, but those applications are not installed by the user and generally cannot be uninstalled or replaced. User-controllable applications are separated from the rest of the system, and generally are sandboxed to prevent them from doing damage if they turn out to be malicious or become compromised.</p>
<p>Debian (and by extension, Kicksecure) doesn’t do this so well. All packages in the repositories are essentially operating system components, with full permissions to do anything the user account the application is launched as allows. Core components like udev and systemd are installed directly alongside productivity apps like image viewers and web browsers. This is a bit messy from the standpoint of system organization, but it also poses a significant security hazard for obvious reasons (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1200/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">XKCD 1200</a> sums up the issue nicely).</p>
<p>Users should be able to install arbitrary applications as OS components and give them elevated permissions, as they’ve always been able to do on Kicksecure and Whonix. But users should also be able to wall off applications into a sandbox of sorts if they don’t trust those applications or may have to process untrusted data with those applications.</p>
<p>Flatpak and Snap are relatively well-known attempts at bringing sandboxing and application isolation to Linux. Both of these are not exactly awesome solutions, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandboxing controls under Linux can be somewhat flimsy without putting a great deal of work into doing things like whitelisting syscalls and the like. In some instances, Linux’s sandboxing features actually worsen security (user namespaces in particular allow access to kernel facilities that aren’t usually available to unprivileged users, exposing additional attack surface; this has been the source of numerous CVEs, but user namespaces are also required by applications that do sandboxing internally, like Chromium).</li>
<li>Users can loosen sandboxing very easily with Flatpak, and without too much effort with Snap, defeating the purpose of the sandbox.</li>
<li>Flatpak and Snap sandboxing oftentimes causes application malfunctions due to restricting resources that applications legitimately need access to.</li>
<li>Applications from the Flathub repository and Snap Store can be uploaded by arbitrary users. This is in contrast to the Debian archive, which requires some level of skill and trust for a packager to gain upload access to it, and where policies help to ensure better packaging quality in general. As a result, Flatpaks and Snaps are oftentimes more broken than apt packages, and it is easy to upload malware to the repositories.
<ul>
<li>Malware actually has been uploaded to the Snap Store and has caused severe damage in the past, with at least one person <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">losing the equivalent of $490,000</a> after plugging in cryptocurrency recovery data into a malicious Exodus Wallet snap. This particular incident underscores the fact that sandboxing apps isn’t really enough, apps can still be malicious without having to break out of a sandbox at all. <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/03/exodus-wallet-part-three/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This same kind of attack happened on the Snap Store multiple times.</a> This is why getting apps from a trusted repository is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we really want is some sort of virtual machine that is integrated with the host <em>enough</em> to allow apps in the VM to feel native or close to native, but sufficiently walled off so that applications cannot do damage to the host system or escape the VM. This would allow running “user applications” in a very tight yet highly compatible sandbox, and would allow pulling those applications from trusted repositories like the Debian repos. It would also allow users to install applications without having to boot into a sysmaint session.</p>
<p>Chrome OS has something similar to this with <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/linux" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Crostini</a>, and Windows has something similar to this with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WSLg</a>. Something with a vaguely similar user experience would likely be acceptable, especially if an “app store” frontend of some sort was available so the user didn’t have to use a terminal to install sandboxed applications.</p>

          <title>Use sdwdate without Tor Control port</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[UniksKorn25]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I would like to use external Tor Socks Proxy with sdwdate at config file <code>/etc/sdwdate.d/50_user.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">PROXY_IP=192.168.7.70
PROXY_PORT=9050
</code></pre>
<p>And have the error (<em>Tor’s Control Port could not be reached</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% sudo journalctl -fu sdwdate
...
Jul 01 10:07:58 localhost sdwdate[706393]: __ ### START: ### /usr/libexec/helper-scripts/onion-time-pre-script

...
</code></pre>
<p>Sdwdate is still running, but <strong>there is no time synchronization</strong>, no any success line in log, like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">...
Jul 01 12:19:37 localhost sdwdate[291586]: 2025-07-01 09:19:37 - sdwdate - INFO - Success.
...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use sdwdate without Tor Control Port?</strong></p>

Or i could keep using my good old bash script for time synchronization behind a proxy as a temporary forced alternative?: <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/use-sdwdate-without-tor-control-port/1116/1">(click for more details)</a>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am reaching out to share some observations regarding missing panel items in the desktop settings for the two users (boot sessions), USER and USERMAINT. These issues were noticed while booting in Live Mode USB, and I believe it would be beneficial to me to provide my feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>USER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
The battery level indicator is absent from the system tray. This is particularly inconvenient for laptop users who rely on this feature to monitor their battery life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>USERMAINT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
Similar to USER, the battery level indicator is also missing.</li>
<li><em>Time Clock Item Missing</em><br>
The Time Clock item is absent from the panel, which is a useful feature for quick access to the current time.</li>
<li><em>Window Buttons Missing</em><br>
The absence of window indicators making it difficult to manage open windows. This has led to me to frustration while multitasking, such as when using the terminal to launch Firefox (look up issues) and Mousepad (take notes) and another xterm for debugging commands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Its good to leave the USERMAINT desktop minimal but the three above would not be too much to add to the panel.</p>

          <title>Set Mousepad to Launch in New Windows instead of Tabs by Default</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[desi_fubu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to share a minor suggestion regarding the default behavior of Mousepad, the text editor included in Xfce. While the default tabbed interface works well for many users, I personally find it a bit inconvenient or more like annoying. Hope this post doesn’t come across as annoying cause its nothing on Kicksecure but Xfce. Furthermore I suspect I’m not the only one who feels this way, especially for those of us who frequently switch between different desktop environments distro hopping and testing.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Mousepad could be configured by default within Kicksecure to open new instances in separate windows rather than tabs. This small change could greatly improve the user experience for those who prefer this behavior.</p>
<p>After some research, I discovered that this setting is managed via dconf (org) rather than a standard Xfce configuration file.</p>
<p>The following command can be used to set the desired behavior:</p>
<p><code>gsettings set org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window opening-mode 'window'</code></p>
<p>To make this change persistent across the system, you could create a drop-in dconf file. For example, you could add the following to a (example file <code>/etc/dconf/db/00_kicksecure-default-apps</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window]
opening-mode = 'window'
</code></pre>
<p>This would ensure that Mousepad opens new instances in separate windows by default. When I went to write notes on things inside of Live USB I couldn’t stand it making new tabs. This is what brought me here and I hope you give it a consideration.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On my Dell Laptop it has a handy hardware WiFi Switch on the side that when switched/toggled it disables all Wireless (WWAN/WLAN/Bluetooth).</p>
<p>When booted from Live ISO (USB) on USER session or SYSMAINT session if I then go to toggle the WiFi switch to disable wireless at any given time it causes the system to permanently freeze. This is regardless if I connect to network first or not before toggling the switch.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Dell Laptops that are in the “Enterprise” category only come with these hardware style WiFi switches or these are just the ones that I have seen. I’m not sure about other brands but it’s nice for the obvious security reasons to disable wireless if you don’t need or are using wired Ethernet connection specifically as I’m doing.</p>
<p>Also why is <code>rfkill</code> not a included as a package or prepackages with the ISO?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>When installing Kicksecure, if you select to erase disk and unselect encryption the two password box but encrypt is still selected.<br>
If you press the tick mark again, the tick mark disappears, but you can’t press next, the button isn’t made clickable.</p>
<p>See more here:<br>
https ://streamable.com/p8jnkd</p>
<p>Doing manual disk partitioning is the only way I have found to get past without disk encryption.</p>
<p>This is happening for both a Hyper-V, VirtualBox and Physical PC installation.<br>
Selected language: English GB<br>
selected timezone: Copenhagen (Locale en-GB, formats DK)<br>
Selected keyboard: Danish (No dead keys)</p>
<p>Regards Lars.</p>

          <title>Howto for Password Reset for Kicksecure Root Account</title>

            <p>Helo,<br>
Kicksecure is installed on a rather old MAC.<br>
User- and Root (Sysmaint-) account have different passwords for login.<br>
I don’t know why but anyhow the password for sysmaint seems to be wrong, so I can’t login.   Access for user is still ok.<br>
Obviously editing Recovery Mode like in other distros is no longer possible as a precondition to set a new password.<br>
Is there another rather simple, direct way to reset the sysmaint password and set a new one?<br>
Thanks for help in advance.</p>

            <p>The last time i played around with veracrypt was back in January, so i know they worked on whatever version was back then. When i try to open a container vera asks for admin password. When i press enter the password window closes but the container is not opening.<br>
If i set up a password and enter it it says that the password is wrong.</p>
<p>I tried both the app image and installing it:<br>

<p>“start-mullvad-browser cannot be run using a symlink on this operating system”</p>
<p>How to reproduce this error on Kicksecure ?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install mullvad-browser using the official repository</li>
<li>Install the last version of firejail (0.9.74) deb package</li>
<li>Run : sudo firecfg</li>
<li>Run : firejail mullvad-browser</li>
</ol>
<p>I wonder if this error is coming from a hardening conf from Kicksecure or maybe the error is coming from firejail itself ? If the error is coming from firejail itself i’m sorry i will report this to them.</p>

          <title>Argon2 pbkdf setup and hardening in Kicksecure</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[ketodiet100]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As of right now the time of writing the default LUKS Argon2id setup is 1GB (1048576 kb) for memory cost and the parallelism setting of 1-4 threads max.</p>
<p>These defaults were established to provide strong resistance to brute-force attacks by requiring significant computational resources, while capping parallelism to avoid excessive load on systems with limited cores. The memory cost ensures high RAM usage during key derivation, making GPU-based attacks more difficult, and the parallelism allows for multi-threaded processing up to 4 threads by default.</p>
<p>The iteration time is often set to around 2000 milliseconds, but memory and parallelism are the key parameters queried.</p>
<p>To verify these defaults you can use the <code>cryptsetup luksDump</code> command to inspect the current settings.</p>
<hr>
<p>Anyway others places have suggested and discussed that if a user has sufficient RAM they should increase it more then the default (1GB) manually.</p>
<p>Should Kicksecure use 1/2 or 1/3 of the total memory or have an option to in Graphical installer to set this?</p>
<p>I think the latter since having a option for advanced installs rather then an <em>“opt-in”</em> one size fits all approach. That would provide for flexibility and user by user use case when installing Kicksecure.</p>
<ul>
<li>1/2 available RAM example</li>
</ul>
<p><code>--pbkdf-memory $(awk -F ' ' '/MemTotal/ {printf "%.0f\n", $2 / 2}' /proc/meminfo)</code></p>
<ul>
<li>1/3 available RAM example</li>
</ul>
<p><code>--pbkdf-memory $(awk -F ' ' '/MemTotal/ {printf "%.0f\n", $2 / 3}' /proc/meminfo)</code></p>
<p>Typically or my understanding is that <code>cyrptsetup</code> will detect the max amount of threads available by the system and will use that when setting parallel defaults.<br>
Documenting how to upgrade a Luks Kicksecure install manually to increase the Argon2 memory cost might be worth mentioning.</p>

          <title>Kicksecure ISO Download Broken?</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Devs and Kicksecure Community,</p>
<p>I’m writing this post to bring to the attention that the Kicksecure ISO release 17.3.9.9 download appears to be broken.</p>
<p>This is how I got to this conclusion and the steps I took first.</p>
<p>First I downloaded it on Ubuntu via the Mullvad Browser and it made it to 1.0 GB then failed. So I remembered that Mullvad Browser uses their own DNS regardless if you have the Mullvad VPN or not. So I turned off their DOH settings and again it failed.</p>
<p>Then I freshly installed Firefox and again it fails at about 1.0 GB of the download. That made me think it was a Firefox thing, so next I tried with Brave Browser and same thing failed at the 1.0 GB mark. The ISO appears to slightly bigger then 1.0 GB. Mind you I checked my free space and despite having 173 GB of free space it failed so obliviously more then enough.</p>
<p>Next I tried downloading other Linux distro ISO’s and all of them fully downloaded. To test my next theory I switched/tried multiple DNS servers and again failed to download Kicksecure successfully.</p>
<p>Lastly I wanted to try another system to see if it was something I did so I booted up a Tails usb to download the Kicksecure ISO and again it failed despite me having more then enough RAM available (16GB).</p>
<p>This is really concerning cause in the past I downloaded one of the first Kicksecure ISO’s with no issue. My mind wants to go to the worst possible outcome, which I hope is not the case. Hopefully this is just a configuration issue on the server that hands out the downloads.</p>
<p>This needs to be looked into and investigated to see whats going on.</p>

            <p>Should Kicksecure stick with the default that Linux defaults to?</p>
<p><code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_local_port_range</code></p>
<p>The default range is 32768 - 60999<br>
I’m not sure why this reasoning and is the RFC-compliant recommended range outdated?</p>
<p>RFC-compliant ephemeral port range <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6335.html#section-6" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">(RFC 6335)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dynamic Ports, also known as the Private or Ephemeral Ports, from 49152-65535</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Would changing the range to something Kicksecure specific increase Fingerprinting?</p>
<p><strong>Should it be increased to 65535?</strong> <code>net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 32768    65535</code><br>
Increased entropy equals better protection against port prediction?<br>
More ports equals less chance of port collisions under high loads?<br>
Does changing it increase attack surface?</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this since Kicksecure is also a consideration for server use?</p>

          <title>Persistent GRUB Boot Issue with Kicksecure and Multiple SSDs</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I initially installed Kicksecure on an SSD in my PC and used it without any issues. After shutting down my PC and removing that SSD, I installed a different Linux distribution on another SSD, which also worked perfectly. However, when I turned off my PC and attempted to boot back into Kicksecure, it only loaded into GRUB, necessitating a reinstallation of GRUB on the Kicksecure installation. This problem recurs every time I boot into another operating system, forcing me to reinstall GRUB to use Kicksecure again.</p>
<p>How can I resolve this issue to avoid repeatedly reinstalling GRUB to use Kicksecure, while still being able to use other operating systems from different SSDs on my PC? Could this issue be related to my BIOS settings, and if so, what specific settings should I check or modify in the BIOS to fix it?</p>

          <title>KickSecure Qubes Template Questions And sysmaint Account</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[fevivav425]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I formerly manually installed KickSecure into Qubes Debian template a few years back and recently installed the independent KickSecure template but was completely caught off guard by the introduction of the highly restrictive user-sysmaint-split feature which prevents the use of sudo and installing software from/in the default user account etc.</p>
<p>I feel the impact to the user experience of this new feature could have been made far bolder/more apparent (rather than just a simple new feature introduction reference) but i do acknowledge the solid reasoning behind the introduction of this important security feature and would still like to give it a go rather than simply bypassing/removing it.</p>
<p>I browsed some info regarding this new feature and understand one must reboot into (rather than simply log out of the current account and straight into) the sysmaint account to install software and make changes etc but am interested to know the recommended way to reboot into this account in a Qubes template given there is no UI shown during the normal boot up process. Please advise.</p>
<p>I also note that during the first steps of template installation instructions it enables the repo “qubes-templates-community-testing” and assume this essentially enables the same option as the “community testing templates” tick box in the Qubes OS Global Config UI menu. Strangely this option still remains unticked in this UI after running the Dom0 terminal command and also even after a restart. Shouldn’t this option now be automatically ticked in the UI after this change using the terminal?</p>
<p>I largely try and avoid enabling testing repos to prevent potentially installing Beta/RC updates which can have stability and other issues at times. Now that KickSecure is installed can i safely disable the “qubes-templates-community-testing” repo or will this potentially prevent/delay KickSecure from receiving important updates? If it must be enabled, is there any way to limit this repo to just KickSecure only and ensure it isn’t available to any of my other VM’s?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help and advice.</p>

            <p>After my previous question about Kicksecure outgoing traffic was answered, I have a further relevant follow-up question.</p>
<p>When trying to compare <strong>Kicksecure Host</strong> to <strong>Qubes Hypervisor  with Whonix</strong>: Is Qubes more secure and reliable regarding avoiding outgoing clearnet traffic, because Tor is <strong>technically enforced</strong> for all outgoing traffic via settings, i.e. there’s always Whonix-Gateway (proxy) in between which acts like a kill switch? From my understanding this is not the case in Kicksecure.</p>

          <title>Questions regarding use of tmpfs formatting and conflicts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[FlapJacket]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello Kicksecure Community,</p>
<p>I have been researching tmpfs and optimal ways to mount places to it in my Kicksecure morph install without conflicting with anything like <code>grub-live</code>, <code>systemd-fstab-generator</code>, and <code>swap-file-creator</code>.<br>
What lead me down this rabit hole was how someone in a “group chat” mentioned how they mounted their /tmp and their /.cache directories to tmpfs essentially making them in volatile memory given they don’t swap.</p>
<p>I dont believe I did it correctly which is leading me to ask here. While some of this might or might not be Kicksecure specific see <code>fstab-vm</code> bellow, I felt this would be a good place to ask since it seems like alot of security researchers and people that know better about linux are here. Who knows maybe this might help someone else or start a wiki entry about this topic.</p>
<p>Alrighty then, I first noticed a error message at boot which I thought at the time was a related conflict to booting into “Live Mode” but I tested that theory my booting normally and it showed both ways.</p>
<p><code>journalctl -b -p err | head -n 3</code></p>

Is the duplicate entry line better for /tmp to tmpfs in /etc/fstab</li>

<p>I distro morphed this install so I’m not sure what came with debian and what came with kicksecure.</p>
<p>Looking at fstab-vm file in the <code>security-misc</code> repository made me look into if that this the incorrect way to mount and confusion?</p>
<p>Looking at line <span class="hashtag-raw">#23</span> doesn’t seem right in formatting and why use bind in conjunction wouldn’t that not align with creating a new tmpfs instance?</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>~/.cache mounted to tmpfs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>What is better for mounting user cache to tmpfs?<br>
Is it or rather would it be better to just mount /tmp to tmpfs then <code>symlink ~/.cache to /temp</code></p>
<p><code>sudo mount -t tmpfs -o defaults,nosuid,nodev,noexec tmpfs /tmp &amp;&amp; ln -s /tmp/.cache ~/.cache</code></p>
<p>Or should setting the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME</code> variable to /tmp/$USER/.cache be better?</p>
<p><code>export XDG_CACHE_HOME="/tmp/$USER/.cache"</code></p>
<p>However don’t most apps not always respect the xdg spec always?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Can I have my cake and eat it too?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Can I have both the /tmp to /tmpfs and XDG_CACHE_HOME set without issue or is it unnecessary?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Issues related to “Live Mode” and encrypted swap with tmpfs mounts?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is there any issue/bottleneck/conflicts with mounting .cache and /tmp to tmpfs with <code>grub-live</code> implementation?</p>
<p>If I or another user have these mount points is there gonna be existing issue when the times I might boot into “Live Mode”?</p>
