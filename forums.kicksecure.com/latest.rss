          <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>

            <p>Hello Kicksecure folks,</p>
<p>I installed Debian on my brand new Western Digital external SSD drive. Then I proceeded to distro morph it following the guide (prob should have went with the ISO route) and everything works as intended.</p>
<p>However when I unplug my SSD or it comes unplugged somehow (has happened before) it doesn’t trigger a full shutdown?</p>
<p>Why doesn’t it fully shutdown when unplugged?<br>
I do want to add that also set up LUKS when I installed Debian.</p>
<p>Do I need to create a udev rule that runs a shutdown script (unmount, cryptsetup luksClose, and sync)?</p>

            <p>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It’s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, <a href="https://searchengine.party" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searchengine.party</a>, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users’ IP.<br>
Thank you for your work <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

          <title>How to use zulucrypt in USER Session?</title>

            <p>Hello. How to use zulucrypt in USER mode / USER live mode? I received an important encrypted secret steganographic container in messenger, but I could not open it due to sudo restrictions. I need to reboot, decrypt file, and then load again in USER mode / live mode to respond to interlocutor. This will be inconvenient (this can be a confidential important conversation where time is crucial - for example, if it is related to investigative journalism). What would you recommend in this case? Installing zulucrypt in Podman or Distrobox?</p>
<p>ps Live mode SYSMAINT is very good for viewing encrypted containers and do not save secret session to disk, when you are not limited by time</p>

            <p>Patrick, does it make sense to limit live mode for increased isolation in user-sysmaint-split, given that disk writing is limited? Live mode is very convenient for testing packages, new programs before installing in PERSISTENT mode. Often I try to install some program, but during installation, I encounter dependency problems, library version issues… as a result, package either doesn’t work or can disappoint me. And then it is very convenient to reboot. Rather than deleting everything I just installed + no traces of such experiments are left on disk</p>

            <p>I tried Kicksecure for the first time. I found that the terminal gave me sudo su (superuser) access without even asking for a password. A very simple privilege escalation hat lets me access the LUKS password from system memory. WTF? I  wanted to try Kicksecure because I saw that it would eventually become Whonix-Host. Is this is a bug?</p>

            <p>You can use Qubes OS the <em>secure OS</em> together with Whonix (anonymity). You can use Kicksecure the <em>security by default OS</em> with Whonix too through VirtualBox.</p>
<p>How should an user who is looking for security and anonymity decide between those operating systems?</p>
<p>The main advantage of Qubes OS is its isolated design. In combination with Whonix you have a gateway which enforces all traffic from all VMs going through Tor.</p>
<p>But you might use Kicksecure as your OS exclusively to start your VirtualBox instance and use Whonix from there for all your work or offline VMs. Kicksecure OS updates would go through Tor by default.</p>
<p>What are the drawbacks in such a setup for using Kicksecure compared with Qubes OS?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I morphed my Debian into Kicksecure on an old Macbook. Before, the optical drive worked fine, now it’s not recognized at all (“eject” and “lsblk” don’t list it).<br>
My understanding is that the kernel KS uses is the same as Debian, but I also found that some kernel drivers a blocklisted for security reasons (such as firewire because it would enable known exploits).<br>
The problem is that I rely on the optical drive. Is there any way to enable it?</p>
<p>Edit: I found this: /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf<br>
Any idea which one is needed for and Apple MacBook2,1 SuperDrive?</p>
<p>SOLVED: by commenting out these lines:<br>
blacklist cdrom<br>
blacklist sr_mod</p>
<p>in:<br>
/etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_blacklist.conf</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Also had to allow the udf filesystem.</p>

<p>is it possible to add a mount and launch virtual disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian.qcow2 (file itself is in /live/image) that it is launched in flows without consumption of additional memory? it will make a kicksecure a fantastically secure system (much cooler than qubes). live mode is perfectly launched by live-ISO, but how to avoid a load on memory with an already installed system, as is done with podman containers? solving this problem of memory load will help strengthen anti-forensicism. I use live mode every day, but even 32g of memory is not enough for working with VMs</p>

            <p>Hello lovely gentlemen, before I get going here I want to say a huge THANK YOU for selflessly automating so many good ideas in one place.</p>
<p>I’ve been unceremoniously digging into your wiki and general documentation, beginning (of course!) with a paradigm of Self Help <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating from GRUB to Systemd-Boot (formerly Gummiboot) and while the port has gone well, the kernel flag:</p>
<p>efi=disable_early_pci_dma</p>
<p>Works in GRUB, but prevents booting in systemd-boot.  Before I go blaming Mr. Poettering for his crimes against humanity (I jest) I wonder if the very intelligent people in this community - with years more experience in this platform than I - may have any thoughts on why this might be.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any insight, time, or just your thoughts.</p>
<p>PS: If you have any thoughts on UKI (Unified Kernel Images) and TPM bindings, I think I have a working layout but if perhaps there are gotchas to consider, or - and this is my greater fear - by switchinig out GRUB I may remove some hardening you have provided, I would certainly like to maintain all of that, and I would love a heads-up if I have wandered into a security minefield in my experimentations.  Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi All, I’m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use <code>history -c &amp;&amp; history -w</code>. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn’t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.</p>
<p>These “Apps” should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</p>

So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there</p>
<p>However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.<br>
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?</p>
<p>Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</p>

            <p>Is there anyway to prevent or “blacklist” certain packages from being installed?<br>
I tried creating a preferences file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist</code> to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
</code></pre>
<p>However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true?</p>
<p>If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</p>

            <p>It might be a good idea to to look at including the <code>tlp</code> and <code>tlp-rdw</code> packages</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TLP supplies separate settings profiles for AC and battery power and<br>
can enable or disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and WWAN radio devices upon<br>
system startup.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting in the <code>/etc/default/tlp config</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># Sets the charge threshold to 80% similar to windows settings as to not overcharge the battery when AC is plugged in
TLP_BATTERY_CHARGE_THRESHOLDS="75 80"
</code></pre>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># This sets the default screen display brightness when on battery to 75 and 100 when plugged in
TLP_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS_ON_AC=100
TLP_DEFAULT_BRIGHTNESS_ON_BAT=75
</code></pre>
<p>Another suggestion would be disabling “GNOME animations” which could<br>
equal Improved Performance, Faster Response Time, and Battery Saving.</p>
<p>Adding these two lines to a custom dconf <code>/etc/dconf/db/local.d/</code></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[org/gnome/desktop/interface]
enable-animations = false
</code></pre>
<ul>

<h1><a name="p-2250-notes-about-other-de-optimizations-speed-performance-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2250-notes-about-other-de-optimizations-speed-performance-1"></a>Notes about other DE optimizations (speed &amp; performance)</h1>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Disable desktop effects</strong> <em>(Linux Mint or Cinnamon Desktop Environment)</em></p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.effect show-desktop false
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Disable compositing for full-screen windows</strong> <em>xfce</em> (may also apply to other Desktop Environments)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfconf-query -c xfwm4 -p /general/use_compositing -s false
</code></pre>
<p>(The global config or a user custom specific file should be located in <code>/etc/xdg/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/</code>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Disabling compositing may improve performance for certain applications, especially games or video players, but it may also disable some visual effects and features like transparency and shadows. If you want to re-enable compositing later, you can follow the same steps and check the options again with “true” instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>On KDE If you want to disable the compositor entirely</strong> (which will affect all windows, not just full-screen ones), you can do so with the following command:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kwriteconfig5 --file kwinrc --group 'Compositing' --key 'Enabled' 'false'
qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor suspend
</code></pre>
<p>To re-enable it, you can use:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kwriteconfig5 --file kwinrc --group 'Compositing' --key 'Enabled' 'true'
qdbus org.kde.KWin /Compositor resume
</code></pre>

          <title>Installing FDE LUKS with Detached LUKS header option</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[JuicyOdds]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>You know there are great things that have been discussed/mentioned in the other thread called “BusKill” which shreds the LUKS header. Which leads to the data being useless due to it being no different then random data forensically.</p>
<p>Instead of that it would be better if Kicksecure developed the feature and option when selecting Full Disk Encryption via LUKS at installation. <strong>To have the option to detach the LUKS header</strong> and store it on another device whether that be a USB, SD Card, Smart Card, Yubikey, Nitrokey, etc.</p>
<p>The main development would be the integration into Grub as it would have to ask for device or detect a saved device that has the luks header aswell as ask for the passphrase. The other integration would be into the graphical installer (e.g. Calamares) for selecting such a option.</p>
<p>Currently there is no option to set up a Linux install with FDE and a detached header. However this implementation would greatly servers and personal computers alike.</p>
<p>Here is a good read about this topic.</p>
<p>skrilnetz .net/bullet-proof-data-encryption-with-luks-and-a-detached-header/</p>
<p><strong>In summery here are the Benefits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced Security</strong>: – By separating the header from the encrypted data, users can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their encrypted storage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Flexibility</strong>: – Users can choose to store the header in a more secure location, such as a different device or a secure cloud storage solution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Improved Usability</strong>: – This feature would cater to advanced users who require additional security measures for their sensitive data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Plausible Denial</strong>: – By using a detached header, users can claim that the encrypted storage contains random data, as the absence of the header makes it impossible to decrypt the contents without the correct key. This provides a layer of plausible deniability, as users can assert that they do not possess the means to access the data.</p>
</li>

            <p>At the time of writing, verified boot with reasonable security and usability using user-custom keys for Open Source Linux desktop distributions comparable to some Android hardware is unavailable due to a lack of hardware/firmware support (at least on the Intel/AMD64 platform).</p>
<p>The gigantic <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> wiki page has grown as large as it has because <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> and I have been trying to wrap our heads around how verified boot with reasonable security, usability, and user-custom keys for Open Source (Linux) distributions, comparable to some Android hardware, could be implemented.</p>
<p>Sponsor PUP (related: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency">Transparency</a>) will pay an OEM with firmware development skills to revise that wiki page with the goal of drafting a concept on how this could be implemented and identifying areas that might require further research.</p>
<p>If we are lucky, and if financially feasible, this might result in the development of hardware/firmware that allows for full verified boot to be implemented and actually realized.</p>

          <title>Onion APT repositories connection timeouts solution?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Quiksilver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Tor onion APT repositories can sometimes fail when updating. This can can happen due to the slowness of generated onion circuits or having a custom <code>/etc/tor/torrc</code> can cause them to timeout when updating.</p>
<p>In fact the Tails project since 6.4 removed the onion Debian repositories</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Switch to using HTTPS addresses instead of an onion addresses for the Debian and Tails APT repositories. This makes the Additional Software feature more reliable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://tails.net/news/version_6.4/index.en.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tails - Tails 6.4</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I created a config <code>/etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99timeout</code></p>
<p>(15 seconds till timeout, 5 seconds till retry, and retries 3 times.)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Acquire::http::Timeout "15";
Acquire::http::Retry-After "5";
Acquire::Retries "3";
</code></pre>
<p>I’m not sure how the integration tor and APT works but this would only effect http repos which also are what onions are.</p>
<p>This configuration seemed to work for me but I’m not sure if this fix is placebo?</p>
<p>In closing I don’t think Kicksecure should follow the same route of removing Onion repositories or Onion Debian repositories as thats one thing i strongly disagree with choice of the other project.</p>

            <p>Hi guys. I am using Kicksecure on a virtual machine. Host is ubuntu. I really like ubuntu. in the documentation you say Kicksecure used to work on ubuntu, but you chose debian because of potential problems with canonical. in the documentation you say grub-live can work on ubuntu /wiki/Grub-live#Compatibility, but I tried installing it on ubuntu, mint 22 and kubuntu and grub menu item does not appear. please help me what I should change in code to make it work on ubuntu. I would like to be able to run live mode for the whole system. this could be an additional defense for those using Kicksecure on an ubuntu host. thank you</p>
