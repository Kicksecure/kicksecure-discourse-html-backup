          <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>

          <title>Request and Idea for including a tmpfs-setup package?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0x506c61746f]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This idea was inspired by this users post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-regarding-use-of-tmpfs-formatting-and-conflicts/1057" class="inline-onebox">Questions regarding use of tmpfs formatting and conflicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summery of idea in a nutshell is basically to make the package set /tmp mount point to tmpfs and add a <code>/etc/profile.d/</code> drop in to set the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache</code> variable for all users shell.</p>
<h2><a name="p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1"></a>Idea for /etc/profile.d/xdg-cache.sh</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh

## Set XDG_CACHE_HOME to a per-user cache directory.
#   Prefer a private sub-directory under /tmp when /tmp is a tmpfs.
#   Fall back to ${HOME}/.cache if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
#
## Detect whether /tmp is a mount point (i.e. a separate filesystem).
#    On most modern distros this will be a tmpfs, but on some it may
#    be a regular disk partition.
if grep -q "^tmpfs.*/tmp.*tmpfs" /proc/mounts || mountpoint -q /tmp; then

    # /tmp is a mount point - assume it is a tmpfs.
    BASE_ROOT="/tmp/${USER}"
else
    # /tmp is part of the root filesystem (disk based).
    # Use the traditional default users /home based cache location instead.
    BASE_ROOT="${HOME}"
fi

## Build the final cache directory path.
#    We always put the cache in a ".cache" sub-folder so that tools
#    that follow the XDG spec find what they expect.
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_ROOT}/.cache"

## Ensure the directory exists and is private to the user.
#    /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), so we must create a
#    private subtree and lock it down with chmod 700.
#
# Create the parent directory (only needed when we are using /tmp)
if [ "${BASE_ROOT}" != "${HOME}" ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -d "${BASE_ROOT}" ]; then
    mkdir -p "${BASE_ROOT}"
    chmod 700 "${BASE_ROOT}"          
fi

# Now create the .cache directory itself
mkdir -p "${CACHE_DIR}"
chmod 700 "${CACHE_DIR}"

## Export the variable so the rest of the session sees it.
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${CACHE_DIR}"
</code></pre>
<p>For the above To make it more bullet‑proof, you could tighten the /tmp detection for the <code>export XDG_CAHCE_HOME="/tmp/${USER}/.cache</code> creation</p>
<p>Systemd can generate a tmpfs mount for /tmp via the tmp.mount unit, but that unit is optional and can be disabled.<br>
In live environments, the initramfs (often via dracut in Kicksecure case) typically mounts tmpfs at /tmp automatically.<br>
Either the package should detect this and not interfere. otherwise a more robust way would be to ship <code>/etc/fstab</code> to be mounted to tmpfs by enabling and masking the builtin systemd unit, completely bypassing the need to fiddle with /etc/fstab. This is via enabling systemd’s tmp.mount unless it interferes with grub-live?</p>

<p>Would this be a good idea to implement or do you think its a waste of time since grub-live “Live Mode” already exists and it could complicate its implementation or conflict with it with complexity?</p>

<p>fedoraproject . org/wiki/Features/tmp-on-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solaris has been doing this since 1994. (Much like other Unixes, too.) Debian’s next release defaults to tmpfs on /tmp, too. ArchLinux defaults to this as well. Ubuntu has plans for their 12.10 release.</p>

<p>www . debian. org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From trixie, the default is for the /tmp/ directory to be stored in memory using a tmpfs(5) filesystem. This should make applications using temporary files faster, but if you put large files there, you may run out of memory.</p>

          <title>Chvt - change foreground virtual terminal (VT) (tty) - prevent malware from forced tty change</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Issue:</p>
<p>Malware could switch to another tty but can’t attempt to log in there or feed any data. Malware could pull the user from an emergency session tty back to the original graphical session where the malware runs.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>login into a tty3 - ideally as root</li>
<li><code>chvt 3 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; chvt 2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This also works which is a bit scary. So chvt can even boss around root.</p>
<p>This forced terminal change is something I’d like to fix.</p>
<p>Non-solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Require sudo”: chvt does not require sudo/root.</li>
<li>“Set chvt noSUID”: chvt is already non-suid.</li>
<li>“Delete chvt”: chvt is a user-space utility. Malware could ship the same tool or malware could run the same syscall. Deleting chvt therefore does not accomplish very much.</li>
<li><code>/etc/security/access.con</code> Is only PAM configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real solution:</p>
<p>The only solution is a proper system configuration.</p>

<p>I tried renaming the file to dist-installer-cli and then it works, but then it starts downloading whonix and I don’t want that.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have 1 more question, earlier in the wiki i read information about sysrq and the key combination <strong>alt + printscreen + o</strong> for emergency system shutdown. i enabled this on my system and it works, but i couldn’t find any more information in the wiki.</p>

            <p>Kicksecure initates Tor connections by default to check for updates and download updates etc.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous to have Kicksecure active 24/7 even when not using it actively as state actors could potentially correlate connection patterns to deanonymize you?</p>
<p>Or is it even more dangerous to shutdown your Kicksecure device when not actively using it as they could correlate your Tor connections with your real life patterns, e.g. you shut down Kicksecure when leaving your physical location with your personal mobile device which is linked to your identity?</p>
<p>I am aware of this is an anoymity question and this is not a target of Kicksecure but related to Kicksecure.</p>

This would allow the device to attack arbitrary services with open ports on the host. A firewall would help here (maybe, depends on whether it blocked the LAN or not), but what might help even more is if NetworkManager didn’t automatically connect the system to any wired network interfaces it sees.</p>
<p>Would it be desirable to turn off this wired autoconnect feature by default? Users could still use wired networks, they would just have to explicitly connect to them using the network management widget.</p>

          <title>Systemd Service Hardening?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was learning about the options for Systemd services for restricting or in another word “hardening” services.</p>
<p>This made me question does Kicksecure deploy certain hardening for it’s services or certain Kicksecure specific services?</p>
<p>These are some interesting options I will note here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateNetwork=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives the service its own network namespace. It can’t see or use the host’s network interfaces unless you explicitly bind sockets. Seems useful to prevent leaks or prevent services from being ran without networking?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivatePIDs=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivatePIDs=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives a service an isolated view of the process table, which is a useful “defense in depth” measure, especially for daemons that don’t need to inspect or manage other system processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateTmp=yes/no</code></a><br>
Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp for the service, isolating it from the host’s temporary directories. One service can’t read temporary files left by another service, which mitigates attacks that rely on guessing or stealing temp‑file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#MemoryDenyWriteExecute=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes/no</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service. (helps mitigate code‑injection attacks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>ProtectSystem=full/strict/yes</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service.</p>
<p>There is many others but these few caught my eye.</p>

            <p>Its not only can cause a usability issue as <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Troubleshooting#Dual_Boot">mentioned here</a>, but its a <a href="https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/multibooting-qubes/18988">security issue</a> as well:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One problem is that when you dual or multiboot, even if you are using encryption on your Qubes installation, /boot is still unprotected and could be maliciously modified by the other OS, possibly leading to Qubes itself being maliciously modified.</p>
<p>The other problem is firmware security - for example the other system could infect the BIOS firmware, which might enable compromise or spying on the Qubes system.</p>

          <title>USBGuard - what should we allow or disallow by default?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Kicksecure 18 is intended to ship USBGuard by default, with a configuration that should block likely-malicious, unknown, and unusual devices. The hope is that it won’t block so much as to significantly increase the difficulty of using Kicksecure, while also making it more difficult to use devices such as the Hak5 rubber ducky or O.MG plug (popular keystroke injection devices).</p>
<p>Our current USBGuard configuration is visible at <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">security-misc/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf at master · Kicksecure/security-misc · GitHub</a>. The original intent was to allow everything connected at boot, and then disallow everything other than mass storage devices, keyboards, and mice, while also not allowing keyboards or mice to be combined with other interfaces, and not allowing additional keyboards and mice to be attached if one is already present. However, as pointed out by Marek (the lead Qubes OS developer), this is going to cause <em>tons</em> of legitimate devices to be blocked: <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/commit/cba16879eff9d3d998c127e41c38d2067cdf04cc#r164474977" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Polish USBGuard configuration · Kicksecure/security-misc@cba1687 · GitHub</a></p>
<p>We have a pretty classic security vs. usability tradeoff here. We don’t want to block so much that users disable USBGuard because they can’t live with it, but we also don’t want to allow so much that malicious devices work in common configurations. It’s already risky enough allowing keyboards and mice to be attached after bootup, since if the only keyboard and mouse present on bootup is non-USB (as is the case with most laptops if you don’t plug additional devices into them), keystroke injection devices that present themselves as only a keyboard will be able to attack the system and succeed. But blocking <em>everything</em> other than keyboards, mice, and storage devices may be overkill also.</p>
<p>Does anyone have input on what should be blocked or not blocked by default? Some USB devices to think about here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcams
<ul>
<li>On its own, a webcam probably can’t cause too much trouble… the worst it could do is video the user on the user’s own machine, it would probably be much more useful for an attacker to record the user with an <em>attacker-controlled</em> machine, which of course USBGuard can’t do anything about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microphones
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headsets/speakers/miscellaneous other USB audio devices
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>Could introduce attack surface that we don’t want, see <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part I</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MIDI interfaces
<ul>
<li>Probably pretty rare, no idea what the risks are of allowing these to be used by default, would probably block them just in case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreens
<ul>
<li>Input device, similar to a mouse, might even be handled already by allowing mice in the system. Dangers are similar or identical to allowing mice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android devices
<ul>
<li>Uses or at least used to use Media Transfer Protocol. Unsure what the risks are here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USB Ethernet
<ul>
<li>Oftentimes uses RNDIS, which the Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman has tried to get disabled in Linux at least <em>three times</em> due to supposedly unfixable security issues. (<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024</a>) I would consider this very high-risk and would NOT enable it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bluetooth dongles
<ul>
<li>Could be used to attach arbitrary devices to systems remotely, but this would require some user interaction. Unsure what the implications of a malicious Bluetooth dongle would be. Internal Bluetooth cards actually use the USB bus, but they’ll be present on boot and thus allowed, if everything works as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2FA keys
<ul>
<li>I believe these present themselves as a human interface device, not sure how safe or unsafe this is or if it’s feasible to allow it by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else we should consider allowing or not allowing by default?</li>
</ul>

            <p>Hey everyone! I am not sure if this the best place to post this, so if it is not, sorry in advance.</p>
<p>I am trying to configure reticulum which is a new kind of decentralized network and it auto connects over IPv6 to other nodes on the network.</p>
<p>When I checked if IPv6 was enabled in Kicksecure, it says it is not.</p>
<p>Reading the docs, I found this on the DNS security page:<br>
/wiki/DNS_Security</p>
<p>" * The user’s computer has a local IPv6 but no actual IPv6 connectivity which might confuse DNS resolvers such as <code>unbound</code>."</p>
<p>My question is: is it safe to enable IPv6?</p>
<p>Why is turned off by default, and should I take any additional security/privacy measures if I decide to enable it?</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I’m installing kicksecure in a new laptop. The network wasn’t working and I’ve tried installing drivers but no luck. The only thing that has worked is installing a different version of the kernel and now the wifi is working fine.</p>
<p>For the installation of the new kernel I’ve followed this:<br>
kicksecure(.)com/wiki/Kernel#Package_Installation</p>
<p>Now this command <code>uname -r</code> give me this: <code>6.12.38+deb12-amd64</code></p>
<p>The questions:<br>
Is this system secure or is more vulnerable?<br>
When kicksecure will use this kernel in the stable repository?<br>
Should I now remove this file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list ?<br>
I think not, but I guess that I should remove it only when the kernel I need is in the stable repository…</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>Live mode option boots into persistent sysmaint</title>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I updated my Whonix Gateway (VirtualBox) today and upon rebooting, Live mode was no longer an option to choose from.</p>
<p>I took a look at the /etc/grub.d/10_20_linux_live to see if I could spot anything that might’ve broken, but I didn’t notice anything wrong.</p>
<p>I decided to start fresh by importing the .ova file for the newest version (17.4.4.6, stable). However, upon booting and performing an update in system maintenance mode, trying to reboot and choose the Live User Session mode seems to open System Maintenance mode with persistence each time.</p>
<p>I’ve already deleted my old appliance for this fresh copy of the gateway and workstation. I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m not a developer or power user, but if there is any way I can help to figure out what’s happened, please advise.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Jake</p>
<p>EDIT:  Have tried a reinstall of grub-live (‘sudo apt install --reinstall --no-install-recommends grub-live’) but no improvement, it still boots into Sysmaint with persistence when choosing Live User Session.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: **Adding here for others reference, it was actually booting into Live mode as arraybolt3 explains in their response, I just got confused by the system maintenance panel showing on boot and had expected to see the word Live in the top right. **</p>

<ul>
<li>No longer install Firefox by default.
<ul>
<li>Reason: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Default_Browser#Firefox_Selling_User_Data">Mozilla terms of service change related to selling user data</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>No longer install Thunderbird by default.
<ul>
<li>Reason: Same as above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Implemented and installed Browser Choice by default. (Thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@ArrayBolt3</a>!)

</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live">grub-live</a>
<ul>
<li>added <a>live-hardener</a>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p><code>live-hardener</code> detects writable filesystems and remounts most of them read-only, then adds a live overlay on top. This is similar to what Debian’s dracut’s 90overlay-root does for the root filesystem, but applies to most other writable filesystems on the system, thus reducing persistence even in more complex setups.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Therefore, it is now compatible with the <code>btrfs</code> file system.
<ul>
<li>As a result, feature request <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/use-btrfs-as-the-default-journaling-file-system/626/8" class="inline-onebox">Use Btrfs as the default journaling file system - #8 by Patrick</a> is now unblocked.</li>

Discussion revealed that there’s a good reason to leave setgid in here, which is essentially defense-in-depth (sometimes users may want to revert Kicksecure’s default of kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2, e.g. to debug a program, and Kicksecure should not be less secure than vanilla Debian in that situation).

<li>perf(permission-hardener): optimize string match. Replace subprocess grep calls with bash substring matching in check_nosuid_whitelist function. This eliminates ~10k unneeded subprocess spawns that were causing significant performance degradation. In testing, it improves overall script execution speed by an order of magnitude. (Thanks to Ashlen!)</li>
<li>fix(permission-hardener): add exactwhitelist permissions for ssh-agent. (Thanks to Ashlen!)</li>
<li>fix(permission-hardener): ssh-agent gets 755 perms. Replace the commented-out matchwhitelist entry for ssh-agent with an explicit permission entry (755) for /usr/bin/ssh-agent. When ssh-agent’s matchwhitelist entry was commented out in commit 7a5f8b87af, permission-hardener began resetting it to restrictive defaults (744), preventing non-root users from executing ssh-agent. This broke split SSH functionality in Qubes OS for me because I was using Kicksecure in the vault qube, and ssh-agent runs under a non-root user in that configuration (see <a href="https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/split-ssh/19060" class="inline-onebox">Split SSH - Community Guides - Qubes OS Forum</a>. As noted in the comment, Debian installs with 2755 permissions as a way to mitigate ptrace attacks, but this rationale doesn’t apply due to kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2 being set in Kicksecure.

###<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> The problem you're addressing (if any)

Right now any boot modes advertised by a template will be visible for both that template and any AppVMs derived from it. This might not make sense for all boot modes - Kicksecure would like to implement an "unrestricted admin" boot mode that removes the user-sysmaint-split package during early boot to allow the user full `sudo` access for that boot only. This would take advantage of the fact that rebooting an AppVM resets most of its root filesystem to make this change temporary, so that users can switch between safe and unrestricted modes. This boot mode only makes sense for AppVMs, it would be detrimental for a Kicksecure template to be booted in this way.

### The solution you'd like

Add another boot mode qvm feature class, `boot-mode.restrict.(boot-mode-name)`, which can be set to either `AppVM` or `TemplateVM`. The boot mode will then be restricted to that VM type (i.e. if the feature is set to `AppVM`, that boot mode will only be available for AppVMs, not TemplateVMs).

This could potentially be made more flexible by allowing the feature to be set to a comma-separated list of the VM types the boot mode should be supported in (AppVM, TemplateVM, DispVM, RemoteVM, etc.), but I fear that might cause problems because of the presence of AppVM default boot modes. If a template sets a boot mode that isn't supported by DispVMs as the AppVM default boot mode, what should a DispVM based upon that template do? Thus why I believe this should only allow two restriction choices. "AppVM" in the context of this option really would only mean "anything other than a TemplateVM". Perhaps the wording should be adjusted accordingly, not sure.

The only problem I can see 

### The value to a user and who that user might be

Less confusing in the user interface, users won't see boot modes that they shouldn't be using.

    <p class="github-body-container">### The problem you're addressing (if any)

(This is somewhat of a followup to a<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> conversation I had with Demi and Marek in the Qubes OS Matrix room.)

Currently, Qubes OS allows booting a Qube with special kernel command line parameters by using a special cli-only feature (sadly I can't remember the name of the tool used for this). If you don't do this, each qube is simply booted with some default command-line parameters, which are sufficient to allow the VM to boot and be usable. Thus far, this has been good enough, since each OS booted in Qubes generally doesn't have multiple boot modes that need to be supported.

With the introduction of the [user-sysmaint-split](https://github.com/kicksecure/user-sysmaint-split) feature into Kicksecure and Whonix, things have changed somewhat. As a form of defense-in-depth on top of the security Qubes and Kicksecure already provide, Kicksecure will soon offer a package (really a set of packages) that will allow separating user and root responsibilities much more strongly than usually done. The current implementation uses file permissions on the `sudo` and `pkexec` executables that makes them only able to be run by a special `sysmaint` user, which is locked by default and cannot be signed into normally. This makes `sudo` and `pkexec` completely unable to be run during a normal user session, greatly reducing the risk of a root compromise. To gain access to the `sysmaint` account, the user must physically reboot the machine and select "PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT" from the list of boot options - doing so triggers a systemd unit that unlocks and automatically logs into the sysmaint account. For added security, most if not all non-essential services are suppressed while booted into sysmaint mode, and a very minimal desktop named [sysmaint-panel](https://github.com/kicksecure/sysmaint-panel) is provided to discourage the user from launching potentially dangerous applications like Firefox while in this mode. Users can run privileged commands even when not booted into sysmaint mode through an SUID-less privilege escalation framework called [privleap](https://github.com/Kicksecure/privleap).

This is all well and good, but right now this only works on physical hardware and traditional virtual machines (virt-manager, VirtualBox), because it requires the user to be able to boot into "sysmaint mode", which requires access to a GRUB console. Qubes VMs don't usually even use GRUB (since they share the dom0 kernel which is directly booted by Xen), and even when they do for some reason, you don't get access to the console during bootup unless you're using an HVM. This puts Qubes OS users in a bit of a sticky spot if they want to take advantage of the features offered by user-sysmaint-split. In UX terms, basically the end result is that `sudo` and `pkexec` become permanently unusable, and to get root access the user has to open up a root console either via `qvm-run` (which is dangerous because of X11) or via the "Open console in qube" feature of Qube Manager (which is secure and neat but also slow and somewhat difficult to use). Most of the "nice bits" of user-sysmaint-split are not accessible. In addition, Kicksecure templates will *also* be basically "locked down" by this, making it tricky to make changes or install software in the templates without resorting to one of the above solutions. Only AppVMs really need `sudo` and `pkexec` locked down, ideally a Kicksecure template should have full root access out of the box.

Last but not least, Qubes OS only supports specifying custom kernel parameters for a qube if that qube shares dom0's kernel. If you use a VM-internal kernel, you can't set the kernel parameters because those are hardcoded into a GRUB config file within the qube. This is a problem since Kicksecure has some interest in using qube-internal kernels by default, and obviously users may want to use custom kernels or the like without losing the ability to control (or even use) user-sysmaint-split.

### The solution you'd like

The solution I have in mind here isn't really one solution, but rather a set of them that fixes all of the paper cuts here:

* Templates should be able to specify auxiliary kernel parameters that Qubes OS should use when booting them and AppVMs based on them. Each template should be able to specify more than one set of kernel parameters, one per boot mode it supports.
* These boot modes should somehow be exposed to the end user. How exactly this should look I'm unclear on - an easy solution would be to provide a drop-down in Qube Manager's settings window that would allow selecting the boot mode the VM should use on next bootup. A potentially more usable solution would be to integrate the boot modes into the application menu somehow, but this could overcomplicate the user interface and might also be a massive pain to implement.
* Templates should be able to specify the default boot mode for themselves and the default boot mode for derived AppVMs separately. This way the Kicksecure template could be set up so that it would boot in sysmaint mode by default, while AppVMs would be booted in user mode by default. This would allow the Kicksecure template to be used in an intuitive fashion similar to most existing templates.
* There should be some way to boot a VM with dom0-specified kernel parameters *even if* you're booting using a qube-internal kernel. Demi, Marek, and I had a pretty long discussion about how this could be done, ultimately it seems that pvgrub is the best tool to use for this, but will need some extra features for it to work.
* In a perfect world, the user should be able to define their own boot modes. That would make this rather complex suite of features be useful for much more than just Kicksecure and Whonix.

None of this is set in stone, I'm definitely open to alternate ways of implementing things that would be easier. This is obviously a very large list of features, which I intend to contribute or at least help contribute.

### The value to a user and who that user might be

user-sysmaint-split will work really, really nicely in Qubes OS. Additionally, with the ability to specify auxiliary kernel parameters in templates, Kicksecure and Whonix could use the extensive hardening parameters they use on the desktop within Qubes as well. Users who need or want to tweak their kernels and kernel config will also have much more freedom to do so, which could benefit Qubes OS devs as well as highly advanced users.

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not sure there’s much to discuss here, this is just me doing a brain-dump of my research so that it’s not lost and so that others can comment on it as desirable.</p>
<p>The current iteration of sdwdate does a pretty good job of keeping the system’s clock accurate but skewed just enough to provide better anonymity under Whonix. However, it has a few shortcomings we’d like to resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only sets the time for the (virtual) machine it runs on, it isn’t able to act as a server for helping other virtual machines running on the same system to also synchronize their time securely. This is something that would be nice to fix in Qubes OS, allowing sys-whonix (or more likely, sys-ops-whonix once that exists) to act as a master time-keeper for all VMs.</li>
<li>The current way it adjusts the clock is somewhat awful - it does a large clock jump or two to get the time close enough to accurate to allow connecting to Tor, then does a large number of small clock jumps to get the time to a final “good” value. Clock jump confuse software in multiple ways, and the small clock jumps we do currently can result in systemd journal being flooded, so they’re best avoided, and if they’re needed, it’s best to do one clock jump and then slew the clock to the correct time using something like <code>adjtimex</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core sdwdate code is good and should probably not change too much. What should probably change is the <code>sclockadj</code> tool that is used for doing small clock jumps, and we need a way to allow sdwdate to provide time values for other VMs to sync themselves to.</p>
<hr>
<p>The below is my research into using adjtimex, The tl;dr: is that <strong>we probably should not use adjtimex for initial clock synchronization after boot, but it may be usable to keep the clock in sync thereafter.</strong></p>
<p>Properly adjusting a clock using <code>adjtime</code> or <code>adjtimex</code> (slewing it to the correct value using in-kernel support) is very, very slow. According to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/188620/535873" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">time - How long will NTP take to adjust the clock if it doesn't immediately set it? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a> it takes approximately 4.17 minutes to adjust the clock by 128 milliseconds, or at least it did in 2015. In my testing with adjtimex, this is still approximately correct - it appears that adjtimex adjusts the clock by 500 microseconds per second. This means it takes a little over 33 minutes to adjust the clock by one second.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that Tor (and therefore sdwdate) only allow us to resolve time to within a second at best because that’s the resolution of the HTTP headers we get. On top of that, we get the time from three different servers at once when using sdwdate and then go with the median value of those three times, meaning that in practice we’re not going to be within a second of accuracy because of network lag and all sorts of other things NTP is designed to work around and Tor isn’t. On top of that, we also randomize the clock a bit for greater anonymity, meaning that we might change the clock several seconds on each invocation of sdwdate. When it takes over half an hour to move the clock by one second, making a multi-second change will take <em>hours</em>. Now if we assume that the system’s clock is fairly accurate, and we only ever have <em>one</em> time randomization offset per session (generated randomly each session but never changed until the next reboot, I guess), we can probably skew the clock by a second or two on each sdwdate invocation without too much trouble. But if the network is shaky (for instance, the user is using cellular internet in bad conditions), it’s likely sdwdate will be trying to make much larger changes.</p>
<p>(Note, anecdotally it seems that sdwdate doesn’t see any particular need to change the clock in my KVM virtual machine when I restart sdwdate, at least while my network is working well. The median time difference keeps being 0. That being said, other time differences were frequently reported that were not the median, so I assume that users won’t always get this lucky.)</p>
<p>The current <code>sclockadj</code> code adjusts the clock by 5 million nanoseconds per second. This is <em>ten times</em> faster than adjtimex, which adjusts by 5 hundred thousand nanoseconds per second. Thus sclockadj can handle multi-second adjustments without too much grief, but only by doing clock jumps. Switching to clock slewing with adjtimex will slow down our time adjustments very much.</p>
<p>The 500 microseconds per second adjustment rate is not configurable, it is unfortunately hardcoded in the kernel’s NTP code, which the <code>adjtimex</code> system call uses to do its work of slewing the clock. There isn’t any way to do a “fast slew” to my awareness, unless we want to try to contribute a feature for this to the kernel (which… might be possible?).</p>
<p>Based on the above, I think we might get away with using adjtimex to keep the clock in sync once it is initially synchronized. For making an adjustment of a second or two, it’s probably enough. But on first boot, when the clock is most likely to be several seconds slow or fast (especially on machines with no BIOS battery or a broken battery), we probably need to just use a clock jump. This is similar to the behavior of ntpd.</p>
<hr>
<p>For making sdwdate able to act as a server under Qubes OS, there are a couple of issues to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qubes OS currently synchronizes all VMs to dom0’s time, at least when resuming after suspend. But we would like for dom0 to be able to synchronize itself to sys-(ops-)whonix also.</li>
<li>Every VM on the system should ideally have slightly different time, and should get their time values from a different sdwdate time sync invocation (to avoid one bad sync affecting all VMs on the system).</li>
</ul>
<p>To work with the first issue, we can simply have all VMs (including sys-(ops-)whonix) blindly trust dom0’s time to begin with. Once a successful sdwdate sync is done however, the VM should record how its time differs from dom0’s time. Then, on resume-from-suspend, the VM can take the time given to it by dom0, and adjust it by the offset before syncing the clock. Any time dom0’s clock changed, it would have to announce this to all running VMs so they could recalculate their offsets from dom0.</p>
<p>To work around the second issue, we need some way for a virtual machine to get “whatever the current time is +/- some fixed offset” each time they synchronize their clock with the ClockVM. The fixed offset should be unique per-machine and per-boot, but should be constant between boots to avoid needing lots of clock jumps forward and backward. To acheive this, the client process that gets the time from the ClockVM should create a random identifier on launch, and present that identifier to sdwdate every time it syncs the clock. When sdwdate sees an identifier it hasn’t seen previously, it should generate a new random offset, but if it sees an identifier it’s seen previously, it should use the same offset it presented last time. This way each VM can have its time a little bit different, but that “little bit different” will be static for each virtual machine (until the client VM or ClockVM is rebooted, at least).</p>
<p>We don’t have to tack a bunch of code onto the existing sdwdate code base in order to make it able to act like a server. We should just create a new server process that serves whatever the ClockVM’s current time is (+/- the fixed offset described earlier) to clients. This probably won’t be very difficult to do at all. We will need this server process to NOT serve time until after sdwdate has synced the clock, but thankfully sdwdate already reports its status to other processes on the same VM, so we can rely on that.</p>
