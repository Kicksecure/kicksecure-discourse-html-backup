          <title>Power management for physical hardware in Kicksecure 18</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Right now, idle power management is planned to be disabled under virtual machines, both Qubes and non-Qubes, in Kicksecure 18. However, it’s unclear how we want to handle power management on physical hardware.</p>
<p>First off, a lot of the power management features of LXQt include the ability to suspend or hibernate the machine. Hibernation obviously has security risks because RAM contents are dumped to the disk, but hibernation likely doesn’t work out of the box on Kicksecure anyway, and LUKS can mitigate most of the concerns. What is more concerning is suspend, because LXQt unfortunately puts the system into suspend <em>before</em> locking the screen. This means if one wakes the system, they will be shown a flash of the user’s desktop before the screen locks. It’s extremely brief, but it’s more than long enough to capture a snapshot of the user’s screen with a camera (and depending on the speed of the system it might be enough to deploy a malware payload via a rubber ducky or similar before the screen locks).</p>
<p>LXQt has a lot of power management features; going through each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery watcher. Allows the user to lock their screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, turn off external monitors, and/or receive a notification when the system’s power gets too low. Can warn users for some period of time before taking a power management action in response to a low battery. Also shows a battery level icon.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very little concerns. An attacker who gets access to an encrypted but unlocked system might use the charge level to decide whether or not they want to keep the system powered on while moving it to a more convenient attack location, or if they want to attempt an attack right where they’re at, but in all likelihood hiding this info likely won’t defend against most realistic attack scenarios.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Same concerns as for battery level, this is probably even less worrisome.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Same concerns as battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Security impact identical to battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Minor positive security impact, though most users would be better served by automatically locking the screen after some duration of idle time.</li>
<li>Suspend: Minor negative security impact (could be problematic if the battery reaches a low power level before the screen locks due to idleness, due to screen locking prevention discussed above).</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Usually not a concern because it doesn’t work out of the box.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Minor positive security impact, though again this would be better handled by an idle timeout.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Very minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very useful for laptop users. Mobile users could run out of power mid-work without this.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Useful for the same reason as the battery level icon.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Positive usability impact. Mitigates issues introduced by automatic power management actions.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Annoying because it suddenly creates a popup window like so: <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png" data-download-href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd" title="Screenshot_20251031_162822"><img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png" alt="Screenshot_20251031_162822" data-base62-sha1="v6nqZuM6SBVxaI1P7Qsp42TiPk9" width="568" height="500" srcset="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_852x750.png 1.5x, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png 2x" data-dominant-color="9DA3C1"></a></div> Possibly dangerous, users could lose work if they tried to click inside a window right where the shutdown, reboot, or logout button appeared just as the window popped up. The power management warning is only a partial mitigation for this.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Rather useless for preserving battery life, mildly annoying even with the warning timer.</li>
<li>Suspend: Mildly annoying, but may prevent loss of work by preserving battery power. The warning timeout mitigates this. Overall, positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Same usability impact as suspend, except it takes longer to enter and exit hibernate. Overall, possibly positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Very annoying and dangerous, user will lose all unsaved work when the power level gets too low unless they are able to immediately plug in a source of power when the warning notification appears. Not sufficiently mitigated by the warning timeout, unless the timeout is made very long.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Possibly somewhat useful for avoiding data loss since powering off monitors may improve battery life, but this isn’t that useful. Mildly annoying. Attempts to use xset to power off monitors, thus it doesn’t even work under Wayland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid watcher. Controls what happens when the user closes the lid of the system. Can lock the screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, or turn off monitors when the lid is closed. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC power, and also support separate settings for when an external monitor isn’t attached and when it is.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>No difference in security concerns between the different customization possibilities (on battery / on AC / with external monitor connected / without external monitor connected) except in as much as each option applies to individual user threat models. For instance, a user might only plug their system in while at a location safe from physical attackers, thus their threat model would permit more convenient settings while plugged in and require more safe settings while unplugged.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render whatever they were actively working on inaccessible to a physically present attacker, barring a screen lock bypass or vulnerability in another component of their installation.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact. Closing the lid will indefinitely prevent the screen lock and allow a physically present attacker to capture a screenshot of their work as explained above.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. If user has unencrypted swap, this is virtually fatal when defending against a physically present attacker, as they can capture not only everything that was on the screen, but the full memory contents of everything on the system. If swap is encrypted and requires a passphrase to unlock, this probably won’t suffer from the indefinite screen lock pause issue because a password will be required to resume. If swap is encrypted but a TPM can unlock it, then this suffers from the same issues as suspend. (Note to readers: This is all theoretical, Kicksecure lacks features that would be needed to do things like unlocking an encrypted hibernation volume with a passphrase or TPM with a vanilla Kicksecure configuration.)</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render everything they were doing inaccessible to a physically present attacker, even if their system contains vulnerable components. However, shutdown may be slow, giving an attacker a window of opportunity to extract useful data before the system shuts down (most attackers probably will not be able to act fast enough for this to be of any use to them). Would be better if there was a way to trigger emerg-shutdown when the lid was closed.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Extremely minor positive security impact, maybe, but so negligible as to call it nonexistent unless dealing with an attacker in possession of technology that can reconstruct screen contents based on the light coming from the screen’s reflection off the laptop chassis. Even then, some laptops turn off their screen in hardware when the lid is closed. Might have more of a positive impact if external monitors can be turned off also.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>The different customization possibilities have different usability concerns based on the action in question.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Most users used to WIndows will expect that closing the lid will result in the screen being locked. (They would also expect the system to suspend, but at least this fulfills some of the expectation.)</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. On one hand, most users used to Windows will expect taht closing the lid will result in the system going into suspend. On the other hand, suspend may interrupt actions such as software updates, downloads, long running processes, etc., and thus be undesirable for some users.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact. User has to wait for RAM contents to be reloaded from swap upon resume, and may need to authenticate before the system fully resumes.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they or someone else (usually a pet) closes the lid unintentionally.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness Watcher: Controls what happens when the system has been idle for some duration of time. Has the same set of power management actions as the lid watcher. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC, and allows configuring the time before the system is considered idle. Can disable idleness checks when a fullscreen app is in use. Also offers backlight change settings, but these will almost certainly not work for users with user-sysmaint-split installed.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. Users who forget to lock their screen before walking away from their machine will be protected from a physically present attacker, if that attacker doesn’t manage to see the screen contents of the user’s system before the lock screen activates.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact due to the locking issue described at the top of the post.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Identical concerns as for the hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact for the same reasons as the lock screen idleness action. Protections against exploits are stronger.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Same security impact as the “Turn Off monitor(s)” idleness action, but likely less effective than truly turning off the monitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Users used to Windows will not expect their system to be accessible to an adversary who shows up and looks at the system after some amount of time has passed.</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. May improve battery life, but can also interrupt long-running processes, see usability concerns for suspend lid close action.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact, see usability concerns for hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they have to step away from the system for longer than the configured idle time.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Positive usability impact due to power savings, but usually this won’t work as mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power keys: Allows configuring what to do when the user presses a power, suspend, or hibernate key. These options do nothing under Wayland, power keys are configured by the compositor instead, thus skipping this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I’d recommend the following settings for physical hardware installations based on the above analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery Watcher:
<ul>
<li>Low power action: Nothing</li>
<li>Warning timeout: 30 seconds</li>
<li>Level is low at: 10%</li>
<li>Show icon: Yes</li>
<li>Icon for the icon: Whatever the default is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid Watcher:
<ul>
<li>When lid is closed on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>When lid is closed on AC power: Lock screen</li>
<li>Disable the extra settings for when using external monitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness watcher:
<ul>
<li>When idle on AC: Lock screen</li>
<li>AC idle time: Unsure. For paranoid setups, a very short time might be preferable (30 seconds is the shortest supported timeout), but IMO people should not be relying on the idle timeout for security anyway because it is by nature unreliable. Thus we can probably favor usability here since security is better obtained by other means. Maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>When idle on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>Battery idle time: Unsure, maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>Disable backlight change</li>
<li>Do not disable idleness checks when fullscreen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

            <p>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?</p>
<p>At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.</p>
<p>I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So I’m totally new to Kicksucure. I want to try it out and play around with it in a VM using Virt manager using Mint as the host OS. That way I can get a feel for it and download my apps.</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to figure out how to set a persistant VM though! Whenever I shutdown that VM then try to open it I get a black screen saying no bootable device found and have to delete and then spin up the VM again.</p>
<p>I have tried booting from a USB and still can’t figure out how to set a persistant mode. I would kinda like to use kicksecure as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Article “Non Anonymous Onion Encryption and NAT Traversal” mentioned building Tor software with Tor2Web mode but this build option has been removed by Tor Project a long time ago (since 0.3.5.1-alpha in 2018):</p>
<p><code>https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/maint-0.3.5/ChangeLog#L888</code></p>
<p>I don’t know how to update this article because I don’t understand how to change this. Does having to jump through 4 hops instead of 6 still delivers the purpose of being faster/lower latency NAT traversal? Or is it preferred we remove this article as a whole?</p>

<p><strong>sudo systemctl disable tor</strong></p>
<p>, but I still get this error message:</p>

<p>I really love Kicksecure and Whonix, so thank you to all for providing this.</p>
<p>I was thinking of distromorphing kicksecure for a metal install and wanted to avoid systemd. As many researchers agree that it can be a  security issue.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to distromorph from Devuan?<br>
How many packages would need to be changed that rely on systemd?</p>

          <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>

          <title>Request and Idea for including a tmpfs-setup package?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0x506c61746f]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This idea was inspired by this users post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-regarding-use-of-tmpfs-formatting-and-conflicts/1057" class="inline-onebox">Questions regarding use of tmpfs formatting and conflicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summery of idea in a nutshell is basically to make the package set /tmp mount point to tmpfs and add a <code>/etc/profile.d/</code> drop in to set the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache</code> variable for all users shell.</p>
<h2><a name="p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1"></a>Idea for /etc/profile.d/xdg-cache.sh</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh

## Set XDG_CACHE_HOME to a per-user cache directory.
#   Prefer a private sub-directory under /tmp when /tmp is a tmpfs.
#   Fall back to ${HOME}/.cache if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
#
## Detect whether /tmp is a mount point (i.e. a separate filesystem).
#    On most modern distros this will be a tmpfs, but on some it may
#    be a regular disk partition.
if grep -q "^tmpfs.*/tmp.*tmpfs" /proc/mounts || mountpoint -q /tmp; then

    # /tmp is a mount point - assume it is a tmpfs.
    BASE_ROOT="/tmp/${USER}"
else
    # /tmp is part of the root filesystem (disk based).
    # Use the traditional default users /home based cache location instead.
    BASE_ROOT="${HOME}"
fi

## Build the final cache directory path.
#    We always put the cache in a ".cache" sub-folder so that tools
#    that follow the XDG spec find what they expect.
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_ROOT}/.cache"

## Ensure the directory exists and is private to the user.
#    /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), so we must create a
#    private subtree and lock it down with chmod 700.
#
# Create the parent directory (only needed when we are using /tmp)
if [ "${BASE_ROOT}" != "${HOME}" ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -d "${BASE_ROOT}" ]; then
    mkdir -p "${BASE_ROOT}"
    chmod 700 "${BASE_ROOT}"          
fi

# Now create the .cache directory itself
mkdir -p "${CACHE_DIR}"
chmod 700 "${CACHE_DIR}"

## Export the variable so the rest of the session sees it.
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${CACHE_DIR}"
</code></pre>
<p>For the above To make it more bullet‑proof, you could tighten the /tmp detection for the <code>export XDG_CAHCE_HOME="/tmp/${USER}/.cache</code> creation</p>
<p>Systemd can generate a tmpfs mount for /tmp via the tmp.mount unit, but that unit is optional and can be disabled.<br>
In live environments, the initramfs (often via dracut in Kicksecure case) typically mounts tmpfs at /tmp automatically.<br>
Either the package should detect this and not interfere. otherwise a more robust way would be to ship <code>/etc/fstab</code> to be mounted to tmpfs by enabling and masking the builtin systemd unit, completely bypassing the need to fiddle with /etc/fstab. This is via enabling systemd’s tmp.mount unless it interferes with grub-live?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Would this be a good idea to implement or do you think its a waste of time since grub-live “Live Mode” already exists and it could complicate its implementation or conflict with it with complexity?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>fedoraproject . org/wiki/Features/tmp-on-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Solaris has been doing this since 1994. (Much like other Unixes, too.) Debian’s next release defaults to tmpfs on /tmp, too. ArchLinux defaults to this as well. Ubuntu has plans for their 12.10 release.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>www . debian. org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From trixie, the default is for the /tmp/ directory to be stored in memory using a tmpfs(5) filesystem. This should make applications using temporary files faster, but if you put large files there, you may run out of memory.</p>

          <title>Chvt - change foreground virtual terminal (VT) (tty) - prevent malware from forced tty change</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Issue:</p>
<p>Malware could switch to another tty but can’t attempt to log in there or feed any data. Malware could pull the user from an emergency session tty back to the original graphical session where the malware runs.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>login into a tty3 - ideally as root</li>
<li><code>chvt 3 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; chvt 2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This also works which is a bit scary. So chvt can even boss around root.</p>
<p>This forced terminal change is something I’d like to fix.</p>
<p>Non-solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Require sudo”: chvt does not require sudo/root.</li>
<li>“Set chvt noSUID”: chvt is already non-suid.</li>
<li>“Delete chvt”: chvt is a user-space utility. Malware could ship the same tool or malware could run the same syscall. Deleting chvt therefore does not accomplish very much.</li>
<li><code>/etc/security/access.con</code> Is only PAM configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real solution:</p>
<p>The only solution is a proper system configuration.</p>

<p>I tried renaming the file to dist-installer-cli and then it works, but then it starts downloading whonix and I don’t want that.</p>
<hr>
<p>I have 1 more question, earlier in the wiki i read information about sysrq and the key combination <strong>alt + printscreen + o</strong> for emergency system shutdown. i enabled this on my system and it works, but i couldn’t find any more information in the wiki.</p>

            <p>Kicksecure initates Tor connections by default to check for updates and download updates etc.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous to have Kicksecure active 24/7 even when not using it actively as state actors could potentially correlate connection patterns to deanonymize you?</p>
<p>Or is it even more dangerous to shutdown your Kicksecure device when not actively using it as they could correlate your Tor connections with your real life patterns, e.g. you shut down Kicksecure when leaving your physical location with your personal mobile device which is linked to your identity?</p>
<p>I am aware of this is an anoymity question and this is not a target of Kicksecure but related to Kicksecure.</p>

            <p>Random idea that hit me while writing <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/usbguard-what-should-we-allow-or-disallow-by-default/1248/7:">https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/usbguard-what-should-we-allow-or-disallow-by-default/1248/7:</a> one potential threat vector for USB devices is if they provide a virtual Ethernet interface. This would allow the device to attack arbitrary services with open ports on the host. A firewall would help here (maybe, depends on whether it blocked the LAN or not), but what might help even more is if NetworkManager didn’t automatically connect the system to any wired network interfaces it sees.</p>
<p>Would it be desirable to turn off this wired autoconnect feature by default? Users could still use wired networks, they would just have to explicitly connect to them using the network management widget.</p>

          <title>Systemd Service Hardening?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was learning about the options for Systemd services for restricting or in another word “hardening” services.</p>
<p>This made me question does Kicksecure deploy certain hardening for it’s services or certain Kicksecure specific services?</p>
<p>These are some interesting options I will note here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateNetwork=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives the service its own network namespace. It can’t see or use the host’s network interfaces unless you explicitly bind sockets. Seems useful to prevent leaks or prevent services from being ran without networking?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivatePIDs=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivatePIDs=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives a service an isolated view of the process table, which is a useful “defense in depth” measure, especially for daemons that don’t need to inspect or manage other system processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateTmp=yes/no</code></a><br>
Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp for the service, isolating it from the host’s temporary directories. One service can’t read temporary files left by another service, which mitigates attacks that rely on guessing or stealing temp‑file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#MemoryDenyWriteExecute=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes/no</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service. (helps mitigate code‑injection attacks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>ProtectSystem=full/strict/yes</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service.</p>
<p>There is many others but these few caught my eye.</p>
