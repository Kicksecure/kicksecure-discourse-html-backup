            <p>So the way I installed Kicksecure was without granting root rights to user to lock it down better.<br>
How can I make it so user can still do upgrade-nonroot without adding user to the sudo group?</p>
<p>Would changing the permissions to the <code>upgrade-nonroot</code> and <code>apt-get-update-plus</code> achieve this?</p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/upgrade-nonroot</code></p>
<p><code>chmod 755 /usr/bin/apt-get-update-plus</code></p>
<p>Would this be a stupid idea? (just want to be able to use user to update/upgrade not install packages)</p>

I want to create a separate Kicksecure secure hardened and no-login user(like <code>www-data</code> for Apache) to run Containers(podman, Docker or LXC), Proxmox or any other software.<br>
The <code>user</code> already have too much privileges and I want to avoid from using it.<br>

          <title>Kicksecure for sys qubes and sys-vpn?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[anarsec]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The documentation states (<code>https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Qubes#Service_VMs</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At time of writing, Kicksecure is unsupported in Qubes service VMs such as <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code>, <code>sys-usb</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Kicksecure distro-morphed with <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code> in particular, what are the current barriers to support, and what is anticipated to potentially break functionality?</p>
<p>Part of why I’m asking is that I’d like to write a Community Guide for creating a <code>sys-vpn</code> qube using Kicksecure (for the Mullvad or IVPN client app, adapted from the guide found here: <code>https://privsec.dev/posts/qubes/using-mullvad-vpn-on-qubes-os/</code>). Does anything jump out at you for why this would be inadvisable?</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">b08dfa6083e7567a1921a715000001fb

<p>Could something like <code>dbus-uuidgen --ensure=/etc/machine-id</code> or <code>systemd-machine-id-setup</code> be used on startup to create new machine each boot without issue?</p>

            <p>I think it would help the community and devs if there was some type of progress board where different features, issues, and testing was tracked and laid out better.<br>
A place to list things that are most needed to be tested like <strong>high priority</strong> and <em>low priority</em> to get to the end goal of a released Kicksecure ISO.</p>
<p>TailsOS uses Issue boards but they are also using GitLab not GitHub.<br>
Something like Issue boards/Milestones (which are more like a progress tracker) that would be great for moving the project forward.</p>

          <title>Create a video of installation from ISO</title>

            <p>Morphing Debian to Kicksecure is easy. VIrtualBox is easy. KVM is hard. ISO is even harder because requires interacting with real hardware (not considering that ISO can be imported to VirtualBox).</p>
<p>Please create a video detailing all the steps from downloading an ISO, flashing the image to a device, booting the live ISO and running Calamares and finally rebooting and booting to the installed system.</p>
<p>Tails has an animation:</p>
<p><a href="https://tails.net/install/inc/videos/boot-menu-key.webm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://tails.net/install/inc/videos/boot-menu-key.webm</a></p>
<p>Found on page <a href="https://tails.net/install/linux/index.en.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux install</a>, step 5/7. Their video only shows the hardest part, entering the boot menu and choosing the device to boot from. A video for Kicksecure could also be only this section, undoubtedly the hardest part, or wait till some youtuber do a 20 minute review video, being 15 minutes of installation and 5 minutes of opening the browser and the terminal and reading the FAQ out loud.</p>
<p>Animations or filming real hardware would do just fine, both have pros and cons. The animation gives more privacy to the maker of the video, but recording real hardware is much more relatable to the user that is seeing another person doing the same thing they are going to do.</p>
<p>Please take a look at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/ISO" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kicksecure Operating System Live ISO, Kicksecure-Host Installer</a> to understand what are the steps to install Kicksecure from ISO. If you don’t understand the steps, please let me know, I wrote that page.</p>

<blockquote>
<h1><em>balenaEtcher</em></h1>
<p>For Windows and macOS, we instruct people to use <a href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/"><em>balenaEtcher</em></a> to copy the USB image onto their USB stick. On top of this, we self-host the downloads of <em>balenaEtcher</em> on our own infrastructure. The <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/etcher-binary" class="inline-onebox">tails / etcher-binary · GitLab</a> repository is added as an <a href="https://ikiwiki.info/plugins/underlay/">ikiwiki underlay</a> on our website.</p>
<p>We self-host a copy of <em>balenaEtcher</em> because:</p>
<ul>
<li>It gives us more predictability on what users end up doing. This is useful in terms of Help Desk.</li>
<li>It prevents 3rd parties from learning a bit more about who uses Tails. Pointing to GitHub from our website would provide direct referrers to GitHub (and maybe Balena too) about who is using <em>balenaEtcher</em> to install Tails.</li>
<li>It prevents GitHub from serving rogue downloads (targeted or not). We might still get a rogue download ourselves but:
<ul>
<li>We download <em>balenaEtcher</em> several times from different locations to prevent targeted attacks.</li>
<li>We download <em>balenaEtcher</em> in a limited time window, which might save our users some supply chain issues. If our users were to download <em>balenaEtcher</em> every time, a short-time supply chain attack would definitely affect some of them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>balenaEtcher has Telemetry (privacy) issues:</p>

- **What happened:** You require me to discover and opt-out of telemetry myself and happily send everything you want prior to that.
- **Do you see any meaningful error information in the DevTools?** No





Given that your product is recommended by Canonical as the way to put their images on storage media, I was unpleasantly surprised to find opt-out telemetry in your product. If you want to exfiltrate information from my machine, please ask me before doing so, so that I can then use a different product to flash images onto media.</span></p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’ve switched my disp sys-usb to kicksecure min template(also disp) with blueman package.<br>
All went good and I could use right away my sys-usb as I would before, except, after a restart, when I start blueman manager(bluetooth manager) and the popup come up with confirmation to auto start bluetooth or not(same as beforehand), when I click on either option(yes/no) the applet just insta crushing and obviously not usable.<br>
Switching back to regular DVM solves the issue, but obviously I want to switch to kicksecure.<br>
Anything you can suggest please?</p>

            <p>Trying to apply kicksecure’s hardenings to Parrot Home edition (Vbox), but i ran into some problems. Here is the output:<br>
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm<br>
Reading package lists… Done<br>
Building dependency tree… Done<br>

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have<br>
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable<br>
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created<br>

The following information may help to resolve the situation:</p>
<p>The following packages have unmet dependencies:<br>
kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable<br>
plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed<br>
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.</p>
<p>Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</p>

          <title>ISO: Change to unencrypted /boot if using Full Disk Encryption</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Calamares setting up encrpyted /boot (which gets decrypted with GRUB2) causes many issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>GRUB2 needs a very long time to decrypt the root disk.</li>
<li>Need to enter full disk password twice, at grub boot menu and systemd during boot. This might be a missing dracut module or bug.</li>
<li>And the worst issue: Keyboard layout issues. There is no way to define keyboard layout during GRUB2 pre-boot full disk encryption password entry. (If there is, these are very complicated, not suitable for a Debian derivative and also break SecureBoot.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be no security issue. This is what most distributions are using. The kernel image is not secret. Unencrypted /boot that Debian (CLI looking) installer (“DI”) is using that too. Encrypted /boot is simply not ready due to these upstream bugs which will very most likely not be resolved anytime soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/1203" class="inline-onebox">Encryption does not work well with non-QWERTY keyboards · Issue #1203 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a></li>

</ul>
<p>TODO:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find a distribution that uses Calamares and implemented unencrypted /boot.
<ul>
<li>Maybe Ubuntu? Check

<li>

</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Linux Mint?</li>
<li>Elementary OS?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Copy over the Calamares config files to Kicksecure (if permissible by the license, which is probably the case).</li>
<li>Change Kicksecure Calamares Installer to the usual unencrypted /boot partition.</li>

            <p>on a debian 12 install, I configured NFS for use on my local LAN. I did intsall network-manager-gnome and openvpn…</p>
<p>after my client was able to mount the remote (local LAN). after installing kicksecure, I cannot get them to connect.</p>
<p>connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.</p>
<p>I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.</p>
<p>I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)</p>
<p>portlist shows tcp 2049<br>
rpcinfo shows<br>
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4<br>
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3</p>
<p>ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working…</p>

            <p>Please help me solve the problem</p>
<p>Clean installation of Debian 12 standard - subsequent distro-morphing in Kicksecure-XFCE exactly according to the instructions<br>
The Live mode menu does not appear</p>
<p>checking the installation:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"> dpkg -l | grep grub-live
ii  grub-live                                     3:4.9-1                              all          grub live boot menu entry
ii  grub-live-initramfs-tools                     3:4.9-1                              all          grub live initramfs-tools dependencies
</code></pre>
<p>That’s where the problem seems to be</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo update-grub

</code></pre>
<p>when I trying <code>sudo apt install --no-install-recommends dracut</code> and then<code> sudo update-grub</code>, a menu appears but the system does not boot</p>
<p>My goal is just to get a working Kicksecure system on a USB flash drive with LIVE mode</p>
<p>Please tell me the easiest way to get such a system</p>
