            <p>Just wanted to post this here for other users that may using keepassxc with TOTP and it failing to spit out correct codes related to sdwdate issue bellow.</p>
<p>I went to set up TOTP inside keepassxc and it kept failing to give the right codes. This led me to figure out that the time has to be correct for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Since I was using a VPN auto connect it would sometimes cause sdwdate to time out due to [VPN → Tor → sdwdate] slow connection or whatnot.</p>
<p>Once I synced sdwdate the issue was resolved.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Based on my past experience with operating systems and software, there is still no great secure operating system developed, especially one based on free software. Most of the necessary software exists, but the challenge lies in integrating it all into a cohesive whole to produce the most secure operating system.</p>
<p>What I will add here are software that already exist in reality, not theoretical ones.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-kernel-system-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-kernel-system-1"></a>Kernel (system)</h1>
<p>Sadly, there is no reliable or usable freedom operating system based on a microkernel design. What we have are only monolithic ones, based on the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>Linux, by design, does not offer the same level of security as a microkernel. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate#Continued_dialogue">It is considered obsolete</a>; nobody would want to build an operating system from scratch based on a monolithic design in nowadays.</p>
<p>Alternatives?</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sel4.systems/">Sel4</a></li>
<li><a href="https://doc.redox-os.org/book/microkernels.html">Redox</a></li>
<li><a href="https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel">Zircon</a></li>
</ul>
<p>All mentioned are in active development and free software (sel4 is copyleft).</p>
<p>What i would avoid for sure is Zircon, because its google based.</p>
<p>What’s left are seL4 and Redox. Both are good, and if I had to choose one, I would choose seL4 due to its maturity.</p>
<p>Note (1): Minix and GNUmach are inactive.<br>
Note (2): Hybrid kernel is not an option.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-packages-policy-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-packages-policy-2"></a>Packages Policy</h1>
<p>The package is only going to be as secure and up-to-date as the upstream developers made it. There must be no interference or external involvement in adding or removing code from any package (no package maintainer).</p>
<h3><a name="p-2980-why-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-why-3"></a>Why</h3>
<p>We have the Debian design, and we’ve seen how flawed it is when it comes to security and feature fixes. It’s horrible in every aspect. What we get from Debian is, at best, working software, but that doesn’t mean it’s secure, up-to-date, or even stable. Issues like packages crashing on shutdown when clicking X or freezing on specific Y action, are common, and such bugs when occurs are unlikely to be addressed in a timely manner.</p>
<p>A major security flaw in Debian and Debian-like philosophies is that if the upstream of a package fixes a security issue and pushes it to their users, Debian often remains unaware of it and will not include the fix in their own package unless it is documented or assigned a CVE. As a result, users remain vulnerable for up to maybe entire five years.</p>
<p>Another issue is the increased complexity in the chain of delivery. The more people who can add, remove, or manipulate the code, the more trust becomes a concern. If the code goes from developer X to intermediary Y (or even more intermediaries) before reaching the user, then the user must trust not only X but also Y and anyone else in the chain. Moreover, X doesn’t know Y or their practices, so X must also trust Y not to tamper with the code. This design introduces unnecessary trust assumptions. Code must be delivered directly from X to the user.</p>
<p>Note: Operating system developers should only interact with core/system-level packages, such as the kernel or desktop environment or VM configs or so.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-system-vs-user-packages-4" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-system-vs-user-packages-4"></a>System VS User Packages</h1>
<p>System packages: Are going to be immutable, meaning read-only, no ability to modify with any rights (This helps as well with <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">Verified Boot</a>).</p>
<p>User packages: Will always be kept up to date.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-kernel-userapp-per-vm-apv-5" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-kernel-userapp-per-vm-apv-5"></a>Kernel (user)/App-per-VM (ApV)</h1>
<p>Realistically, having pure packages working directly with seL4 is not practical. It could take 10 to 20 years or even longer. (Linux has been around for over 30 years, and there are still packages that are Windows-only.)</p>
<p>So to solve this issue, we gonna use an already functional kernel which is linux!.. ok hold on a second didnt we just say that linux is a bad design? Thats correct if its used as the main operating system kernel, but if its used in a VM and that VM runs only a single application like firefox or thunderbird…etc the danger drastically decreased/minimized.</p>
<p>Note: AppArmor, SELinux, Firejail, Containers… all are flawed designs when it comes to relying on them for security with packages running on Linux directly on hardware.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-vm-per-package-per-user-compartmentalization-6" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-vm-per-package-per-user-compartmentalization-6"></a>VM per Package per User (compartmentalization)</h1>
<p>Each VM will run at the user level, and every VM will have its own dedicated user account. This isolation ensures that if a VM is compromised, it won’t lead to the compromise of all user packages or affect other VMs.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-default-block-all-7" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-default-block-all-7"></a>Default Block All</h1>
<p>By default, when any app is installed in the VM, nothing is allowed automatically. Every permission including internet access must be explicitly granted by the user. This approach prevents any unwanted permissions from being applied silently without the user’s notice or consent.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-no-backward-nor-sideward-compatibility-8" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-no-backward-nor-sideward-compatibility-8"></a>No Backward Nor Sideward compatibility</h1>
<p>No Backward: The operating system will continue updating itself for supported XYZ hardware. Once any hardware becomes obsolete, it will no longer be compatible, no legacy support.</p>
<p>No Sideward: There will be no compatibility for Linux, Windows, or BSD software at the system level. Compatibility may exist in App-per-VM. By default, only Linux apps are supported.</p>
<p>Additionally, if any app running in a VM does not work with a specific Linux version or hardware architecture, it is not the operating system’s responsibility to ensure compatibility (upstream issue).</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-packages-source-app-per-vm-9" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-packages-source-app-per-vm-9"></a>Packages Source (App-per-VM)</h1>
<p>One might say that hosting our own packages on our own servers would be the ideal solution, and that’s true. However, with a small team and limited resources, that’s not currently feasible (though it remains the long-term goal).</p>
<p>What we can do instead is source packages from existing systems, whether Gentoo, Arch, Nix, or others as long as we can obtain pure, upstream, patchless packages. Reproducibility is essential here to ensure that the packages have not been tampered with.</p>
<p>Note: We can also support App(per-VM) rollback, or install older version directly, since these packages already exists in these OSs repository.</p>
<p>This approach doesn’t conflict with the core philosophy of keep it updated, as the primary focus remains on using updated software, not rollbacks.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-app-per-vm-hypervisor-type-10" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-app-per-vm-hypervisor-type-10"></a>App-per-VM Hypervisor type</h1>
<p>Type 1 (bare-metal) hypervisors will be used for minimalism, reduced attack surface, and better performance.</p>
<p>seL4 provides <a href="https://docs.sel4.systems/projects/virtualization/docs/libsel4vm.html">libsel4vm</a>, which fits well with this design.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-package-manager-security-11" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-package-manager-security-11"></a>Package Manager Security</h1>
<p>All package delivery must comply with <a href="https://theupdateframework.io/docs/overview/">TUF</a>, meaning delivery path of the packages must be secured without the depends on TLS to do that.</p>
<p>Note: This level of security is not fully implemented by any existing package manager that I’m aware of. However, it can be enforced when using our own packages, especially in the App-per-VM model.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-bootstrappability-12" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-bootstrappability-12"></a>Bootstrappability</h1>
<p>I think this is possible, since the OS will be with minimal packages (as a system level). [<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/bootstrappable_builds">ref</a>]</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-wayland-only-13" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-wayland-only-13"></a>Wayland only</h1>
<p>There wont be x11/xorg nor xwayland, either wayland or no land.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-no-rescue-mode-14" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-no-rescue-mode-14"></a>No Rescue mode</h1>
<p>Rescue mode is like giving a backdoor to your own OS or software. If you break your system or forget your password, it’s your responsibility, no one else’s and no help will be provided, because there’s nothing anyone can do.</p>
<p>This also encourages users to maintain proper backups of their data, whether on their own hardware or in the cloud.</p>
<p>(Rollback and Snapshots helps as well)</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-architecture-cpu-support-15" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-architecture-cpu-support-15"></a>Architecture &amp; CPU Support</h1>
<p>Only x86 will be supported, due to its widespread use (Intel or AMD CPUs). Support may be extended in the future to other freedom (or almost freedom) based architectures, such as RISC-V.</p>
<p>ARM or similar proprietary architectures will not be supported—there’s no reason to waste time on them. Supporting the most common proprietary architecture (x86) is sufficient. (Though seL4 supports ARM).</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-no-stupid-or-old-devices-support-16" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-no-stupid-or-old-devices-support-16"></a>No Stupid or OLD Devices Support</h1>
<p>There wont be any old or nonsense software support in the system level (like IRC in the kernel?! or Floppy Disk Support…)</p>
<p>If necessary, such support may be possible within the App-per-VM (ApV) model, since it’s based on Linux and already includes support for these kinds of legacy features. However, this will never be a priority.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-only-latestbest-encryption-used-17" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-only-latestbest-encryption-used-17"></a>Only Latest/Best Encryption Used</h1>
<p>Since there will be no backward compatibility, only the best and most secure options available will be used, whether in TLS versions, cipher suites, OS-level encryption, or any other security-related components.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-offline-installation-18" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-offline-installation-18"></a>Offline Installation</h1>
<p>It is more secure to avoid installing the operating system while connected to the internet, as also advised in <a href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-manual/ch03s03.en.html">Debian’s security manual</a>.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-offline-system-core-19" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-offline-system-core-19"></a>Offline System Core</h1>
<p>Similar to Qubes OS, the system core/base will not be connected to the internet (essential for security purposes).</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-non-systemd-init-20" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-non-systemd-init-20"></a>Non-Systemd Init</h1>
<p>Although not a direct security issue on its own, systemd is a bulky piece of software and has been <a href="https://without-systemd.org/wiki/index_php/Arguments_against_systemd/">heavily criticized</a> for numerous things. The good news is that Genode OS has developed its own lightweight <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/21.05/system_configuration/The_init_component.html">init component</a> that works with seL4.</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-optional-preferable-21" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-optional-preferable-21"></a>Optional Preferable</h1>

<p>It should be easily to achieve this with immutable upgrades (you can rollback to the previous state).</p>

<p>This all can go through only supporting freedom software (software for the ApV must be taken from FSDG distro repository in this case).</p>

<h3><a name="p-2980-nested-virtualization-27" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-nested-virtualization-27"></a>Nested Virtualization</h3>
<p>This feature will be the responsibility of the seL4 team, whether they implement it correctly and securely or not. It’s particularly relevant in scenarios involving running an OS + VM inside another VM, or using a virtualizer/hypervisor within a VM (e.g. VirtualBox-in-VM).</p>
<h1><a name="p-2980-competitors-28" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2980-competitors-28"></a>Competitors</h1>
<p>Proprietary competitors are on the rise. HarmonyOS, for example, is arguably the most mature general-purpose microkernel-based OS developed in China. Google’s Fuchsia is another example. If we don’t stay ahead of these developments, control over security will slip from our hands, placing it instead in the hands of large corporations or state-backed entities.</p>

            <p>I’ve used only Windows since the 80s, so my experience is limited. As I’ve learned about security I’ve become aware of the “Lack” thereof. Last couple of years I’ve been wanting to learn about Whonix which has a reputation for being Secure. However, I don’t know if I should keep the installation of Whonix as a goal in light of the interview with a Whistleblower US Gov’t IT specialist I heard the other night on a Podcast? He worded for US Gov’t in 2016 to a latter date. He became high ranking, and knowledgeable. He reports Microsoft as having the contract with all systems across the Federal Gov’t. He also reports he witnessed Microsoft Tech were ordered to act as “Escorts” to Chinese IT Tech personnel who were stationed in China. These “Escorts” supposedly acted as guides to allow access to the Chinese Tech on all levels? This will become very controversial since the President at the time (Obama) reportedly signed off on it. This is the background to my question since the Whistleblower also reported the “Escorts” also were used with Oracle! So, my question is was or is your Whonix product compromised, and/or is it now secure?</p>

          <title>Kicksecure distro specific keyboard shortcuts</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[init38]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Well I wanted to give some feedback on accessibility/productivity via keyboard shortcuts that would be nice to have in Kicksecure. Xfce is a little different then others but I recall that the Xfce version of Manjaro had shortcuts specific to that OS even on Xfce. In fact I’m more then sure there was another distro that was discontinued but specifically had keymaps set for Chromebook hardware but I don’t member the name? It did however use Xfce as desktop env is what I’m getting at.</p>
<p>I manually created some keyboard shortcuts but these would make Kicksecure more productivity appealing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whiskermenu shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>Super key for menu drop down “Super L” for fast searching</p>
<p>command: <code>xfce4-popup-whiskermenu</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Screenshot shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>Set to the “Print key” but some layouts might be the “End” key</p>
<p>command: <code>xfce4-screenshooter</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Lockscreen shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>“Super + L” just like windows has for locking your workstation when leaving your desk.</p>
<p>command: <code>xscreensaver -lock</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Notepad shortcut</li>
</ul>
<p>“Super + N” or “Super + M” for mousepad since its the default notepad on xfce.</p>
<p>command: <code>mousepad</code></p>
<p>Volume controls (my hardware was not detected)</p>
<ul>
<li>Volume up</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Volume down</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Mute</li>
</ul>
<p>command: <code>amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle</code></p>
<p>Looking into how Kicksecure could set distro specific keyboard shortcuts would make it more complete since my assumption is Xfce is gonna stay.</p>
<p>P.S. Is there any other DE spins going to made for future releases?</p>

            <p>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:</p>
<p>dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory</p>
<p>reboot: system halted</p>
<p>From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)<br>
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</p>

          <title>Rolling vs. Stable release brainstorming</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Detailed overview of the issues with stable and rolling release distributions: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Stable_vs_Rolling_Distributions" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stable vs Rolling Distributions - Security Analysis</a></p>
<p>Kicksecure’s current development strategy for the most part has been to harden Debian as much as is practically possible. This seems to have been working well for the most part, but there are some worries about the safety of some of the rather outdated software that Debian provides us. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical, extremely complicated software like Firefox ESR and Thunderbird can sometimes get stuck with a known-vulnerable version in the latest version of Debian Stable for as long as a month.</li>
<li>Software that isn’t well-maintained may be left in a vulnerable state for long after the vulnerability is made public. (This happened with the zuluCrypt vulnerability discovered in Debian’s zuluCrypt packaging a couple weeks ago or so.)</li>
<li>Tangential to the above, bugs that aren’t considered to be that big of a deal may not be fixed in a stable release of Debian ever. This isn’t really a security issue necessarily, but it is a problem from a usability standpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things would be more-or-less resolved if Kicksecure was a rolling-release distro, for instance by rebasing our code onto a rolling-release variant of Debian (if one were to exist - we sort of almost have one with Debian Testing, but it doesn’t quite serve the desired purpose perfectly). This however is not necessarily more secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling-release distros rolled out backdoored XZ code to end-users during the xz-utils attack. Thankfully (most of) those distros don’t seem to have been targeted by the backdoor at all, but in principle a backdoored upstream or similar supply chain attack can have a much worse impact when using a rolling release.</li>
<li>Rolling releases steadily introduce the latest bugs and vulnerabilities from upstream into the distro on a regular basis. (There isn’t really any way around this, this isn’t a criticism half so much of a statement of fact.) For software that isn’t so complex as to be riddled with unknown vulnerabilities like web browsers, this is a potentially increased danger.</li>
<li>Rolling releases can break a lot. An experienced user can go years or even over a decade without breaking a rolling release install beyond repair, but an inexperienced user can end up with a broken system within a few weeks if they accidentally do something like upgrade their system without checking what packages will be removed in the process. (I’d like to think I’m an experienced user, and I’ve nuked Debian Sid virtual machines multiple times doing this. Not fun.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be possible to combine the advantages of both stable and rolling releases, by keeping Kicksecure’s stable base, but offering “rolling” versions of specific packages like web browsers, email clients, (maybe?) media viewers, etc. Anything that has to handle highly complex untrusted data would be a good candidate for this sort of thing, especially software with a rapid-release cycle. We’re already moving in this direction to some decree with <a>Browser Choice</a>, which is in active development.</p>
<p>What are everyone’s thoughts on the above? Where could our docs use improvement? Are there ideas for how to get the best of both worlds (rolling and stable) other than just a stable base with specific rolling apps? What are some other apps we should probably think about making rolling or recommending that people install rolling versions of if they use those apps? Are there potential pitfalls we need to avoid with rolling apps? (On this last point, we probably should not do what KDE neon did to try to make the Qt and KDE stacks rolling on top of base Ubuntu - that way of doing things kept breaking things for people alarmingly frequently.)</p>

            <p>Dear developers,</p>
<p>Debian, of course, is a very good OS.<br>
But unfortunately, it and its core contain blobs and proprietary firmwares.</p>
<p>Why don’t you switch to PureOS instead of Debian to improve the security of Kicksecure?<br>
Project PureOS has an exceptionally clean kernel and no proprietary firmwares and drivers (and even an open BIOS).</p>

          <title>Dracut compression research</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Patrick asked me to look into the compression options offered by Dracut for initramfs compression. This is the results of that research, written here since the results are a bit lengthy and require the ability to post images for sharing the charts I made.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: I think we should use xz compression. It’s acceptably fast, it compresses way better, and there doesn’t seem to be any compelling reason to avoid it.</strong></p>
<p>The initramfs has to be decompressed by the kernel on boot, so I only researched compression algorithms supported by the kernel in Debian Bookworm. (Trixie supports the exact same compression algorithms, so this research should apply to Trixie as well, assuming the compression utilities perform similarly in Trixie to how they perform in Bookworm, which I find likely given the age of these utilities.)</p>
<p>Bookworm’s kernel and Dracut both support the following compression algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>gzip (this is what we’re using now)</li>
<li>lz4</li>
<li>lzma</li>
<li>lzo</li>
<li>xz</li>
<li>zstd</li>
<li>cat (uncompressed, taken into consideration to provide a best-case scenario for time and a worst-case scenario for size)</li>
</ul>
<p>Dracut also supports bzip2, but Bookworm’s and Trixie’s kernels both did not appear to support that.</p>
<p>To determine which algorithm was most likely desirable, I benchmarked them against each other. The following testing methodology was used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a file, <code>/etc/dracut.conf.d/99-compress.conf</code> to set the compression algorithm in.</li>
<li>For each compression algorithm, change <code>99-compress.conf</code> to specify the desired algorithm, then run <code>time sudo dracut --force</code> three times.</li>
<li>Record the output of <code>time</code> after each dracut invocation.</li>
<li>Record the size of the output initramfs after each dracut invocation.</li>
</ul>
<p>In all instances, the file size of the output initramfs was identical (to within a kilobyte at least) across all three runs of Dracut when using a single compression algorithm, so I only recorded file size once per algorithm. All tests were run in a KVM/QEMU virtual machine with 4 virtual CPUs, 4 GB RAM, and all host CPU features passed through to the guest (<code>-cpu host</code>). The host system has an i9-14900HX processor. The raw results of the benchmarks are as follows:</p>

<p>I did not benchmark boot speed with each of the different algorithms used, although I did verify that the virtual machine booted with an initramfs made with each algorithm. The boot speed seemed pretty much the same to me with each algorithm, and would have been difficult to measure in an objective, reliable fashion. I will note, I may have noticed a very slight speedup during boot with the zstd algorithm.</p>
<p>The following two graphs are provided to visualize the data above (created using LibreOffice):</p>

<p>Takeaways from the above data:</p>
<ul>
<li>From a size standpoint, lzma performed the best, lz4 performed the worst.</li>
<li>From a speed standpoint, zstd and lz4 are about tied for best speed, while lzma is the worst for speed.</li>
<li>lzo/lzop is certainly a bad choice - it approaches lzma in slowness while also making a file larger than gzip and almost as large as lz4. It’s the worst of all worlds combined.</li>
<li>xz is probably the most compelling as far as a balance between good speed and good compression - it’s almost as good as lzma as far as size, while being just a hair faster than gzip.</li>
<li>zstd is a bit of an improvement over gzip in size, while also being very very fast.</li>
</ul>
<p>I am of the opinion that xz is the best choice here based on this data, as our existing compression speed has been acceptable and shaving off 2-3 seconds per initramfs generation doesn’t seem that compelling except perhaps when doing ARM builds of Kicksecure on x86_64 hardware.</p>
<p>It is worth noting, people who know much more about compression tools under the hood than I do have complaints about design flaws in xz, which are documented <a href="https://www.nongnu.org/lzip/xz_inadequate.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a>. I do not believe the issues mentioned in this article are of concern for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article primarily relates to xz’s suitability for long-term archival. Kernel initramfs files aren’t really something where “long-term archival” is a concern.</li>
<li>Most of the article focuses on xz’s lack of resiliency in the face of partial archive corruption. But we don’t care about this at all, we assume the initramfs is bit-for-bit identical to when it was created, and indeed in the future we will likely be signing the initramfs as part of Verified Boot (which will mandate that the initramfs be bit-for-bit idential to when it was created).</li>
<li>Other parts of the article focus on compatibility issues with different versions of xz. This also is not a concern - as long as dracut produces an initramfs that the Linux kernel can read and boot with, things are compatible enough for us.</li>
<li>The rest of the article appears to focus on various design decisions in xz that could have been made better. None of that is relevant for us though, since whatever feature set Dracut is using in xz is good enough to give it a very acceptable compression speed while also providing the second-smallest file size of any of the compression algorithms documented here. Even if xz could be better than it is, right now it’s better than everything else except maybe zstd if you really care about speed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Someone else I saw did <a href="https://linuxreviews.org/Comparison_of_Compression_Algorithms" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">similar compression performance benchmarking</a> and concluded that <code>zstd</code> was the best general-purpose algorithm, though the data they present shows that parallel xz actually performed better than zstd’s best compression in both compression size and speed. One concerning thing this article does point out though is that xz can use a lot of RAM. For this reason, I tried generating a dracut initramfs using xz compression in a Kicksecure-CLI VirtualBox VM with only 512 MB RAM. Memory consumption during the initramfs generation rose to a maximum of 318M according to htop, and went down to 263M once the initramfs was generated, meaning that dracut and whatever tools it ran (including xz) used about 55M of memory during the generation process. Only about 1.97M of swap ended up used. This is much more than both gzip and zstd (which both only require about 5M of memory), but seems acceptable to me. 55M is not that much, especially given that <code>fwupd</code> is just sitting there eating 97M while doing basically nothing.</p>
<p>As a final note, I checked <a href="http://cve.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">cve.org</a> to see if security vulnerabilities were found in either the xz or zstd compressors in the Linux kernel. I found no vulnerabilities for either algorithm (using the search terms “linuz kernel xz” and “linux kernel zstd”).</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe xz is the best compression method for us to use with dracut, due to its slightly better performance and much better compression compared to our current default, gzip. zstd is my second choice, and may be what we want to use if we have problems with xz’s speed or memory consumption.</p>

          <title>Separate (some) user applications from the operating system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Android, iOS, macOS, and Chrome OS all provide a level of separation between user-installed applications and the operating system. The operating system may provide certain applications to the user, but those applications are not installed by the user and generally cannot be uninstalled or replaced. User-controllable applications are separated from the rest of the system, and generally are sandboxed to prevent them from doing damage if they turn out to be malicious or become compromised.</p>
<p>Debian (and by extension, Kicksecure) doesn’t do this so well. All packages in the repositories are essentially operating system components, with full permissions to do anything the user account the application is launched as allows. Core components like udev and systemd are installed directly alongside productivity apps like image viewers and web browsers. This is a bit messy from the standpoint of system organization, but it also poses a significant security hazard for obvious reasons (<a href="https://xkcd.com/1200/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">XKCD 1200</a> sums up the issue nicely).</p>
<p>Users should be able to install arbitrary applications as OS components and give them elevated permissions, as they’ve always been able to do on Kicksecure and Whonix. But users should also be able to wall off applications into a sandbox of sorts if they don’t trust those applications or may have to process untrusted data with those applications.</p>
<p>Flatpak and Snap are relatively well-known attempts at bringing sandboxing and application isolation to Linux. Both of these are not exactly awesome solutions, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandboxing controls under Linux can be somewhat flimsy without putting a great deal of work into doing things like whitelisting syscalls and the like. In some instances, Linux’s sandboxing features actually worsen security (user namespaces in particular allow access to kernel facilities that aren’t usually available to unprivileged users, exposing additional attack surface; this has been the source of numerous CVEs, but user namespaces are also required by applications that do sandboxing internally, like Chromium).</li>
<li>Users can loosen sandboxing very easily with Flatpak, and without too much effort with Snap, defeating the purpose of the sandbox.</li>
<li>Flatpak and Snap sandboxing oftentimes causes application malfunctions due to restricting resources that applications legitimately need access to.</li>
<li>Applications from the Flathub repository and Snap Store can be uploaded by arbitrary users. This is in contrast to the Debian archive, which requires some level of skill and trust for a packager to gain upload access to it, and where policies help to ensure better packaging quality in general. As a result, Flatpaks and Snaps are oftentimes more broken than apt packages, and it is easy to upload malware to the repositories.
<ul>
<li>Malware actually has been uploaded to the Snap Store and has caused severe damage in the past, with at least one person <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/02/exodus-bitcoin-wallet-490k-swindle/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">losing the equivalent of $490,000</a> after plugging in cryptocurrency recovery data into a malicious Exodus Wallet snap. This particular incident underscores the fact that sandboxing apps isn’t really enough, apps can still be malicious without having to break out of a sandbox at all. <a href="https://blog.popey.com/2024/03/exodus-wallet-part-three/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">This same kind of attack happened on the Snap Store multiple times.</a> This is why getting apps from a trusted repository is a good idea.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What we really want is some sort of virtual machine that is integrated with the host <em>enough</em> to allow apps in the VM to feel native or close to native, but sufficiently walled off so that applications cannot do damage to the host system or escape the VM. This would allow running “user applications” in a very tight yet highly compatible sandbox, and would allow pulling those applications from trusted repositories like the Debian repos. It would also allow users to install applications without having to boot into a sysmaint session.</p>
<p>Chrome OS has something similar to this with <a href="https://chromeos.dev/en/linux" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Crostini</a>, and Windows has something similar to this with <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/gui-apps" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">WSLg</a>. Something with a vaguely similar user experience would likely be acceptable, especially if an “app store” frontend of some sort was available so the user didn’t have to use a terminal to install sandboxed applications.</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">PROXY_IP=192.168.7.70
PROXY_PORT=9050
</code></pre>
<p>And have the error (<em>Tor’s Control Port could not be reached</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% sudo journalctl -fu sdwdate

</code></pre>
<p>Sdwdate is still running, but <strong>there is no time synchronization</strong>, no any success line in log, like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">...

<p><strong>Is it possible to use sdwdate without Tor Control Port?</strong></p>

Or i could keep using my good old bash script for time synchronization behind a proxy as a temporary forced alternative?: <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/use-sdwdate-without-tor-control-port/1116/1">(click for more details)</a>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am reaching out to share some observations regarding missing panel items in the desktop settings for the two users (boot sessions), USER and USERMAINT. These issues were noticed while booting in Live Mode USB, and I believe it would be beneficial to me to provide my feedback.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>USER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
The battery level indicator is absent from the system tray. This is particularly inconvenient for laptop users who rely on this feature to monitor their battery life.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>USERMAINT</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Power Manager Icon Missing</em><br>
Similar to USER, the battery level indicator is also missing.</li>
<li><em>Time Clock Item Missing</em><br>
The Time Clock item is absent from the panel, which is a useful feature for quick access to the current time.</li>
<li><em>Window Buttons Missing</em><br>
The absence of window indicators making it difficult to manage open windows. This has led to me to frustration while multitasking, such as when using the terminal to launch Firefox (look up issues) and Mousepad (take notes) and another xterm for debugging commands.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Its good to leave the USERMAINT desktop minimal but the three above would not be too much to add to the panel.</p>

          <title>Set Mousepad to Launch in New Windows instead of Tabs by Default</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[desi_fubu]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I wanted to share a minor suggestion regarding the default behavior of Mousepad, the text editor included in Xfce. While the default tabbed interface works well for many users, I personally find it a bit inconvenient or more like annoying. Hope this post doesn’t come across as annoying cause its nothing on Kicksecure but Xfce. Furthermore I suspect I’m not the only one who feels this way, especially for those of us who frequently switch between different desktop environments distro hopping and testing.</p>
<p>It would be nice if Mousepad could be configured by default within Kicksecure to open new instances in separate windows rather than tabs. This small change could greatly improve the user experience for those who prefer this behavior.</p>
<p>After some research, I discovered that this setting is managed via dconf (org) rather than a standard Xfce configuration file.</p>
<p>The following command can be used to set the desired behavior:</p>
<p><code>gsettings set org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window opening-mode 'window'</code></p>
<p>To make this change persistent across the system, you could create a drop-in dconf file. For example, you could add the following to a (example file <code>/etc/dconf/db/00_kicksecure-default-apps</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[org.xfce.mousepad.preferences.window]
opening-mode = 'window'
</code></pre>
<p>This would ensure that Mousepad opens new instances in separate windows by default. When I went to write notes on things inside of Live USB I couldn’t stand it making new tabs. This is what brought me here and I hope you give it a consideration.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On my Dell Laptop it has a handy hardware WiFi Switch on the side that when switched/toggled it disables all Wireless (WWAN/WLAN/Bluetooth).</p>
<p>When booted from Live ISO (USB) on USER session or SYSMAINT session if I then go to toggle the WiFi switch to disable wireless at any given time it causes the system to permanently freeze. This is regardless if I connect to network first or not before toggling the switch.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Dell Laptops that are in the “Enterprise” category only come with these hardware style WiFi switches or these are just the ones that I have seen. I’m not sure about other brands but it’s nice for the obvious security reasons to disable wireless if you don’t need or are using wired Ethernet connection specifically as I’m doing.</p>
<p>Also why is <code>rfkill</code> not a included as a package or prepackages with the ISO?</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>When installing Kicksecure, if you select to erase disk and unselect encryption the two password box but encrypt is still selected.<br>
If you press the tick mark again, the tick mark disappears, but you can’t press next, the button isn’t made clickable.</p>
<p>See more here:<br>
https ://streamable.com/p8jnkd</p>
<p>Doing manual disk partitioning is the only way I have found to get past without disk encryption.</p>
<p>This is happening for both a Hyper-V, VirtualBox and Physical PC installation.<br>
Selected language: English GB<br>
selected timezone: Copenhagen (Locale en-GB, formats DK)<br>
Selected keyboard: Danish (No dead keys)</p>
<p>Regards Lars.</p>

          <title>Howto for Password Reset for Kicksecure Root Account</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Helo,<br>
Kicksecure is installed on a rather old MAC.<br>
User- and Root (Sysmaint-) account have different passwords for login.<br>
I don’t know why but anyhow the password for sysmaint seems to be wrong, so I can’t login.   Access for user is still ok.<br>
Obviously editing Recovery Mode like in other distros is no longer possible as a precondition to set a new password.<br>
Is there another rather simple, direct way to reset the sysmaint password and set a new one?<br>
Thanks for help in advance.</p>

            <p>The last time i played around with veracrypt was back in January, so i know they worked on whatever version was back then. When i try to open a container vera asks for admin password. When i press enter the password window closes but the container is not opening.<br>
If i set up a password and enter it it says that the password is wrong.</p>
<p>I tried both the app image and installing it:<br>
sudo apt install dirmngr software-properties-common apt-transport-https curl lsb-release ca-certificates -y</p>
<p>curl -fsSL <a href="https://notesalexp.org/debian/alexp_key.asc" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://notesalexp.org/debian/alexp_key.asc</a> | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/alexp_key.gpg &gt; /dev/null</p>

<p>“start-mullvad-browser cannot be run using a symlink on this operating system”</p>
<p>How to reproduce this error on Kicksecure ?</p>
<ol>
<li>Install mullvad-browser using the official repository</li>
<li>Install the last version of firejail (0.9.74) deb package</li>
<li>Run : sudo firecfg</li>
<li>Run : firejail mullvad-browser</li>
</ol>
<p>I wonder if this error is coming from a hardening conf from Kicksecure or maybe the error is coming from firejail itself ? If the error is coming from firejail itself i’m sorry i will report this to them.</p>
