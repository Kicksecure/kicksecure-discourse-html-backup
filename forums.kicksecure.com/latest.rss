            <p>First post, genuine question</p>
<p>I come from Fedora and heard about KickSecure. It definitely piqued my curiosity. So I did a bare metal installation on an old Toshiba Satellite AMD4, UEFI &amp; Btrfs</p>
<p>I am trying to button down the sysmaint profile but keep finding obstacles. So I have reinstalled it twice. I’ve been using ChatGPT for help…. works 50% of the time when it’s not hallucinating</p>
<p>My question (and I have hundreds) can I get Mullvad VPN on Lockdown mode to connect before the ISP connects?</p>
<p>Just one idea I had</p>
<p>[Unit]<br>
Description=Override to enforce early Mullvad lockdown<br>
Before=network-pre.target network.target network-online.target<br>
Wants=network-pre.target</p>
<p>[Service]<br>
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/mullvad connect</p>
<p>But it failed</p>

          <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t expect this to require any bug fix, unless one comes to mind, but just wanted to warn others of my ordeal.  Kicksecure seems an ideal OS for booting on a thumb drive for a very secure environment.  It seems more suitable than Tails for my use cases, as I’d also like to install some software to it.  To test it out, I burnt the live disk to a really OLD Kingston thumb drive of 8GB, and used it to install a persistent, encrypted thumb drive OS that I could e.g. install other softs on with SU privileges, a really old SanDisk 16 GB.  It booted and worked great.  I can even install other software by removing the split.</p>
<p>The Verbatim Seaglass drives seemed attractive, as they have lifetime warranties, which seems like a fairly strong expression of confidence in their shelf life.  I bought two 32GB and two 64, burnt the ISO on a Seaglass, and tried to boot it - this from the same ISO which previously worked.  It generated a bunch of errors and then said something like ‘Boot Failed’.  Note that virtual machines are enabled in both the BIOS’s I tried.  I then tried burning it without the extended volume name option in Rufus, and burnt onto a 64GB instead of a 32, and it worked.  I then plugged in the live disk in with another 64GB, and installed to it from Maint.  It seemed to complete quite happily, but it would not boot on any computer I tried it on, just like the first Live disk I originally burnt.  I compared it to the ancient SanDisk drive that worked.  I noticed in the boot order in the BIOS, I had a choice for the USB itself, and another for the same drive, with a Kicksecure name.  The one that started with USB wouldn’t boot, but the Kicksecure choice would.  Looking at two SeaGlass drives I tried to install to, neither show a Kicksecure choice in the BIOS.  It does not work with Secure Boot turned off.</p>
<p>These Seaglass drives SAY that they work for formatting in EXT4 on Linux.  I seem to have only one significant choice on how to create the installed version: EXT4 or BTFS.  I tried both on one of the drives, but neither gave me a Kicksecure boot choice.  I tried booting it on a port on a hub, and two different ports on my desktop.  No dice.</p>
<p>Based on the principle that if you try to install Windows on a machine, and you get errors instead of an OS, it is a virtual certainty that the HW is bad or incompatible  It seems like a foregone conclusion that the reason for the difference is the thumb drives; but feel free to make any suggestions.  I’ve had mostly good luck with Verbatim blank optical media over the years, but IMHO, this does not look good for them.  It seems like they are Kicksecure incompatible, as is.  I don’t know if it’s a bug in the design, M$ paid ‘em to be incompatible (which here seems unlikely, since they advertise Linux compatibility), or there’s a problem with USB 3.2 Gen 1; or maybe I’m missing something.  Maybe a bug in the KickSecure installer is more likely than Windows, but it seems less likely given that the prob. seems to show up depending on the thumb drive it’s installed on.  Implementing a thumb drive should under it all just be a big block of memory..</p>
<p>My machine is an ancient ASRock Tai Chi X570, with a Ryzen 5 3800X.  The SeaGlass USB drives are for USB 3.2 Gen 1.  This matches the specs on most of the USB ports on my desktop, AND on my USB hub.</p>

          <title>Noob questions VPN/Display resolution</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fazeclan]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to install kicksecure, however before I connect to the internet id like to install a VPN. Managed to do it by entering Sysmaint, mount the usb, copy files to /media/ install the .deb file.</p>
<p>However, I have a question. Now that I have a VPN installed in sysmaint (and host user). Will all traffic be router by the vpn, even clearnet/APT upgrades?</p>
<p>Do I first need to launch the VPN in sysmaint - before updating packages/software for it to cover the APT traffic? ISP → VPN → Clearnet/Tor</p>
<p>Regarding the Display. I only get 1200x<em>800 in resolution, no other suggestions. I figured it is a driver issue</em>…? Linux Mint shows alot of resolutions per default. Not kicksecure. <em>Kicksecure is using MESA drivers and my display (1920 x 1080) is not found. I tried force set display with xrandr but doesnt work. Just throws error codes. How do I switch/change to Nouveau drivers? Or does it not having enrolled the secure boot key therefor preventing Nouveau drivers to load? I have read the nouveau drivers should be included in the linux mainkernel by default. My linux mint test-install showed indeed Nouveau drivers was in use.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind im a total noob to linux. Trying to make the switch to more secure software after having trouble with hacker attacks and malware in windows.</p>

            <p>I wanna install yandex browser and I’m pretty sure it’s kinda nasty thing. I wanna install it for my mom as she’s fluent with russian and yandex has youtube audio translations for russians etc… don’t ask.<br>
anyways, what’s the best way to install it? I mean it’s kinda scary to install it as it is, maybe there’s some recommended way to do so(so the GPU’s acceleration will still work etc)?</p>

          <title>Support for hibernation?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We need to decide what we’re doing with hibernation. Either we should determine how to set it up in a secure fashion and implement that, or we should remove hibernation-related documentation from the wiki and disable the hibernation button in LXQt.</p>
<p>Hardware support challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation may or may not work properly on Linux. Many users seem to have it working without issues, I have yet to get it working on a machine here. From what I’ve heard, SteamOS supports hibernation and has it working reliably, so maybe it’s robust enough to deploy in general now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation takes data that is intended to be ephemeral, and makes it persistent. Any secrets, unsaved work, live-booted virtual machines, etc., are all dumped to a swapfile or swap partition when the system is hibernated, making them much easier for an attacker to access if they can get access to the volume containing the swap file/partition.</li>
<li>This can be mitigated somewhat by using full disk encryption, however this is vulnerable to the possibility that the user will choose a weak encryption passphrase, and of course there’s always the <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench problem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>swap-file-creator would probably need to change in order to support hibernation. Right now we use an encrypted swapfile with an ephemeral encryption key, allowing swap to be used safely but also making it impossible to recover after a reboot. We may also need to do something with the way in which the swapfile is managed, since we need to have a single, static swapfile, we can’t be dynamically creating a new one on every boot or similar.</li>
<li>Hibernation is not reliable if you are trying to hibernate into an existing swapfile. If memory is filled and swap is partially filled, there won’t be enough space left in the swapfile to save the remaining contents of RAM into. SteamOS reportedly gets around this by using a dedicated hibernation file (which I guess means they probably somehow give the resume mechanism multiple swapfiles?).</li>
<li>Hibernation would need to be disabled when FDE was not in use, unless we want to implement something where the user is prompted for a one-time-use passphrase for securing the hibernation file, which is then prompted for upon resume. (Actually, that could be really neat, even with FDE, since it would mean an attacker would have to break both the FDE key and the hibernation key in order to get access to RAM contents. This would require the user to have a very good memory though.)</li>
<li>Related: <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/cryptsetup-suspend" class="inline-onebox">Debian -- Details of package cryptsetup-suspend in trixie</a> Unsure whether we’d want to use this with hibernation or not, or if it works with dracut.</li>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I’m currently using endeavour os on two computers(one with additional nvidia GPU and the other one just with integrated intel’s). I like it mainly because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it never breaks(like after updates etc) and I used different ones before that(ubuntu, fedora, manjaro etc). This one I use on both computers like over 2 years now and with no issues.</li>
<li>for the nvidia GPU laptop I don’t need to think what to do each time something is not right etc. The drivers just work (I use the nvidia’s drivers the system suggest to install).</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT… despite I use hardened kernel, I know that kicksecure is probably way more secure and much more privacy respected system. That’s why I wanna switch, but the above two things are stopping me from it.</p>
<p>Can you please clarify the two points above, because I’m not really a techie and don’t wanna deal with all the under-stuff. I just want my system to just work and be as secure and private as possible.</p>
<p>I feel like when I’ll install it I’ll end up switching back because I will need to pull my hairs off again dealing with the nvidia GPU drivers or that some day after an update the system will not boot or something will not work and again I will pull my hairs off.</p>
<p>P.S: forgot to mention that I use KDE plasma and highly used to it, in case it matters somehow</p>

          <title>Power management for physical hardware in Kicksecure 18</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Right now, idle power management is planned to be disabled under virtual machines, both Qubes and non-Qubes, in Kicksecure 18. However, it’s unclear how we want to handle power management on physical hardware.</p>
<p>First off, a lot of the power management features of LXQt include the ability to suspend or hibernate the machine. Hibernation obviously has security risks because RAM contents are dumped to the disk, but hibernation likely doesn’t work out of the box on Kicksecure anyway, and LUKS can mitigate most of the concerns. What is more concerning is suspend, because LXQt unfortunately puts the system into suspend <em>before</em> locking the screen. This means if one wakes the system, they will be shown a flash of the user’s desktop before the screen locks. It’s extremely brief, but it’s more than long enough to capture a snapshot of the user’s screen with a camera (and depending on the speed of the system it might be enough to deploy a malware payload via a rubber ducky or similar before the screen locks).</p>
<p>LXQt has a lot of power management features; going through each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery watcher. Allows the user to lock their screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, turn off external monitors, and/or receive a notification when the system’s power gets too low. Can warn users for some period of time before taking a power management action in response to a low battery. Also shows a battery level icon.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very little concerns. An attacker who gets access to an encrypted but unlocked system might use the charge level to decide whether or not they want to keep the system powered on while moving it to a more convenient attack location, or if they want to attempt an attack right where they’re at, but in all likelihood hiding this info likely won’t defend against most realistic attack scenarios.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Same concerns as for battery level, this is probably even less worrisome.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Same concerns as battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Security impact identical to battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Minor positive security impact, though most users would be better served by automatically locking the screen after some duration of idle time.</li>
<li>Suspend: Minor negative security impact (could be problematic if the battery reaches a low power level before the screen locks due to idleness, due to screen locking prevention discussed above).</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Usually not a concern because it doesn’t work out of the box.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Minor positive security impact, though again this would be better handled by an idle timeout.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Very minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very useful for laptop users. Mobile users could run out of power mid-work without this.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Useful for the same reason as the battery level icon.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Positive usability impact. Mitigates issues introduced by automatic power management actions.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Annoying because it suddenly creates a popup window like so: <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png" data-download-href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd" title="Screenshot_20251031_162822"><img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png" alt="Screenshot_20251031_162822" data-base62-sha1="v6nqZuM6SBVxaI1P7Qsp42TiPk9" width="568" height="500" srcset="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_852x750.png 1.5x, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png 2x" data-dominant-color="9DA3C1"></a></div> Possibly dangerous, users could lose work if they tried to click inside a window right where the shutdown, reboot, or logout button appeared just as the window popped up. The power management warning is only a partial mitigation for this.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Rather useless for preserving battery life, mildly annoying even with the warning timer.</li>
<li>Suspend: Mildly annoying, but may prevent loss of work by preserving battery power. The warning timeout mitigates this. Overall, positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Same usability impact as suspend, except it takes longer to enter and exit hibernate. Overall, possibly positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Very annoying and dangerous, user will lose all unsaved work when the power level gets too low unless they are able to immediately plug in a source of power when the warning notification appears. Not sufficiently mitigated by the warning timeout, unless the timeout is made very long.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Possibly somewhat useful for avoiding data loss since powering off monitors may improve battery life, but this isn’t that useful. Mildly annoying. Attempts to use xset to power off monitors, thus it doesn’t even work under Wayland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid watcher. Controls what happens when the user closes the lid of the system. Can lock the screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, or turn off monitors when the lid is closed. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC power, and also support separate settings for when an external monitor isn’t attached and when it is.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>No difference in security concerns between the different customization possibilities (on battery / on AC / with external monitor connected / without external monitor connected) except in as much as each option applies to individual user threat models. For instance, a user might only plug their system in while at a location safe from physical attackers, thus their threat model would permit more convenient settings while plugged in and require more safe settings while unplugged.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render whatever they were actively working on inaccessible to a physically present attacker, barring a screen lock bypass or vulnerability in another component of their installation.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact. Closing the lid will indefinitely prevent the screen lock and allow a physically present attacker to capture a screenshot of their work as explained above.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. If user has unencrypted swap, this is virtually fatal when defending against a physically present attacker, as they can capture not only everything that was on the screen, but the full memory contents of everything on the system. If swap is encrypted and requires a passphrase to unlock, this probably won’t suffer from the indefinite screen lock pause issue because a password will be required to resume. If swap is encrypted but a TPM can unlock it, then this suffers from the same issues as suspend. (Note to readers: This is all theoretical, Kicksecure lacks features that would be needed to do things like unlocking an encrypted hibernation volume with a passphrase or TPM with a vanilla Kicksecure configuration.)</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render everything they were doing inaccessible to a physically present attacker, even if their system contains vulnerable components. However, shutdown may be slow, giving an attacker a window of opportunity to extract useful data before the system shuts down (most attackers probably will not be able to act fast enough for this to be of any use to them). Would be better if there was a way to trigger emerg-shutdown when the lid was closed.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Extremely minor positive security impact, maybe, but so negligible as to call it nonexistent unless dealing with an attacker in possession of technology that can reconstruct screen contents based on the light coming from the screen’s reflection off the laptop chassis. Even then, some laptops turn off their screen in hardware when the lid is closed. Might have more of a positive impact if external monitors can be turned off also.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>The different customization possibilities have different usability concerns based on the action in question.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Most users used to WIndows will expect that closing the lid will result in the screen being locked. (They would also expect the system to suspend, but at least this fulfills some of the expectation.)</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. On one hand, most users used to Windows will expect taht closing the lid will result in the system going into suspend. On the other hand, suspend may interrupt actions such as software updates, downloads, long running processes, etc., and thus be undesirable for some users.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact. User has to wait for RAM contents to be reloaded from swap upon resume, and may need to authenticate before the system fully resumes.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they or someone else (usually a pet) closes the lid unintentionally.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness Watcher: Controls what happens when the system has been idle for some duration of time. Has the same set of power management actions as the lid watcher. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC, and allows configuring the time before the system is considered idle. Can disable idleness checks when a fullscreen app is in use. Also offers backlight change settings, but these will almost certainly not work for users with user-sysmaint-split installed.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. Users who forget to lock their screen before walking away from their machine will be protected from a physically present attacker, if that attacker doesn’t manage to see the screen contents of the user’s system before the lock screen activates.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact due to the locking issue described at the top of the post.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Identical concerns as for the hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact for the same reasons as the lock screen idleness action. Protections against exploits are stronger.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Same security impact as the “Turn Off monitor(s)” idleness action, but likely less effective than truly turning off the monitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Users used to Windows will not expect their system to be accessible to an adversary who shows up and looks at the system after some amount of time has passed.</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. May improve battery life, but can also interrupt long-running processes, see usability concerns for suspend lid close action.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact, see usability concerns for hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they have to step away from the system for longer than the configured idle time.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Positive usability impact due to power savings, but usually this won’t work as mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power keys: Allows configuring what to do when the user presses a power, suspend, or hibernate key. These options do nothing under Wayland, power keys are configured by the compositor instead, thus skipping this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I’d recommend the following settings for physical hardware installations based on the above analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery Watcher:
<ul>
<li>Low power action: Nothing</li>
<li>Warning timeout: 30 seconds</li>
<li>Level is low at: 10%</li>
<li>Show icon: Yes</li>
<li>Icon for the icon: Whatever the default is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid Watcher:
<ul>
<li>When lid is closed on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>When lid is closed on AC power: Lock screen</li>
<li>Disable the extra settings for when using external monitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness watcher:
<ul>
<li>When idle on AC: Lock screen</li>
<li>AC idle time: Unsure. For paranoid setups, a very short time might be preferable (30 seconds is the shortest supported timeout), but IMO people should not be relying on the idle timeout for security anyway because it is by nature unreliable. Thus we can probably favor usability here since security is better obtained by other means. Maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>When idle on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>Battery idle time: Unsure, maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>Disable backlight change</li>
<li>Do not disable idleness checks when fullscreen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m new to kicksecure, and I have questions to get it fit my everyday needs.</p>
<p>I can’t connect my android phone to the computer. Once plugged via USB wire, nothing happens, and nothing in Thunar nor in Gnome Disks.</p>
<p>Once plugged, my phone reacts :</p>
<ul>
<li>it charges</li>
<li>and asks me to choose a transfer mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there some packet missing on my install ? Or a config I didn’t do ?</p>
<p>Looking on the forum and on the internet didn’t give any help.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

            <p>Hello, this is my first post! <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>After playing with Kicksecure (template) on Qubes OS I tried to download the live iso and run it.</p>
<p>My computer has HEADS/coreboot as bios and Qubes OS as main OS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately HEADS does not “see” Kicksecure and cannot launch it.</p>
<p>The following github issue tracks the problem: <a href="https://github.com/linuxboot/heads/issues/2008" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">"kicksecure iso doesn't boot under Heads · Issue #2008 · linuxboot/heads · GitHub</a> .<br>
The main developer of HEADS ( <a href="https://github.com/tlaurion" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">tlaurion (Thierry Laurion) · GitHub</a> ) has replicated the issue. If you have any suggestion on how to fix it (or debug it), it would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>thank you in advance</p>

            <p>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?</p>
<p>At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.</p>
<p>I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So I’m totally new to Kicksucure. I want to try it out and play around with it in a VM using Virt manager using Mint as the host OS. That way I can get a feel for it and download my apps.</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to figure out how to set a persistant VM though! Whenever I shutdown that VM then try to open it I get a black screen saying no bootable device found and have to delete and then spin up the VM again.</p>
<p>I have tried booting from a USB and still can’t figure out how to set a persistant mode. I would kinda like to use kicksecure as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Article “Non Anonymous Onion Encryption and NAT Traversal” mentioned building Tor software with Tor2Web mode but this build option has been removed by Tor Project a long time ago (since 0.3.5.1-alpha in 2018):</p>
<p><code>https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/maint-0.3.5/ChangeLog#L888</code></p>
<p>I don’t know how to update this article because I don’t understand how to change this. Does having to jump through 4 hops instead of 6 still delivers the purpose of being faster/lower latency NAT traversal? Or is it preferred we remove this article as a whole?</p>

<p>How can I resolve the error message, and is using Kicksecure this way still secure?</p>

<p>Would it be possible to distromorph from Devuan?<br>
How many packages would need to be changed that rely on systemd?</p>

          <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>
