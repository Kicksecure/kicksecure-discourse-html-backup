<p>Is there any documentation for Kicksecure on how to change the apt-cacher configuration to allow it to work with tor-ified updates?</p>

          <title>Kicksecure for sys qubes and sys-vpn?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[anarsec]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>The documentation states (<code>https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Qubes#Service_VMs</code>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At time of writing, Kicksecure is unsupported in Qubes service VMs such as <code>sys-net</code>, <code>sys-firewall</code>, <code>sys-usb</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Kicksecure distro-morphed with <code>kicksecure-qubes-gui</code> in particular, what are the current barriers to support, and what is anticipated to potentially break functionality?</p>
<p>Part of why I’m asking is that I’d like to write a Community Guide for creating a <code>sys-vpn</code> qube using Kicksecure (for the Mullvad or IVPN client app, adapted from the guide found here: <code>https://privsec.dev/posts/qubes/using-mullvad-vpn-on-qubes-os/</code>). Does anything jump out at you for why this would be inadvisable?</p>

            <p>Hey,</p>
<p>I’ve switched my disp sys-usb to kicksecure min template(also disp) with blueman package.<br>
All went good and I could use right away my sys-usb as I would before, except, after a restart, when I start blueman manager(bluetooth manager) and the popup come up with confirmation to auto start bluetooth or not(same as beforehand), when I click on either option(yes/no) the applet just insta crushing and obviously not usable.<br>
Switching back to regular DVM solves the issue, but obviously I want to switch to kicksecure.<br>
Anything you can suggest please?</p>

          <title>Using Tirdad with FSF libre kernel</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[KickingAlong]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thank you for making Kicksecure available!<br>
I’m using Kicksecure morphed from Debian 11 in Qubes.</p>
<p>Recently I came across Free Software Foundation site saying:<br>
“Linux, the kernel developed and distributed by Linus Torvalds et al, contains non-Free Software, i.e., software that does not respect your essential freedoms, and it induces you to install additional non-Free Software that it doesn’t contain.<br>
Even after allegedly moving all firmware to a separate project as of release 4.14, Linux so-called “sources” published by Mr Torvalds still contain non-Free firmware disguised as source code.”</p>
<p>If you read more on their site, you’ll find a few examples of that misguiding of the Linux  community, and it seems a serious threat to security of most Linux systems, while most users do not care.</p>
<p>So, following the Qubes guide to install the custom kernel, I installed the Freesh Libre Debian kernel (LTS) available at fsfla dot org.</p>
<p>The installation was easy and successful. No problems in Kicksecure/Qubes, such as would be with any unsupported hardware devices. The current LTS version is linux-image-5.15.85-gnu.<br>
After some testing, I removed the stock linux-image-amd64 files and their headers. Now I only have the FSF kernel, and Kicksecure works OK.</p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why don’t the devs of Kicksecure and Whonix offer the option to use this FSF kernel, as it’s cleaned from the proprietary and disguised code? And put this info in Wiki?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My next step is to install Tirdad, which requires the kernel headers. I installed the corresponding FSF LTS headers package, currently linux-headers-5.15.85-gnu.<br>
However, Tirdad doesn’t take it. It’s requiring the same vanilla linux-headers-amd64, linux-headers-5.10.0-20-amd64, and linux-headers-5.10.0-20-common.<br>
How can I tell Tirdad to use linux-headers-5.15.85-gnu?<br>
Hope I don’t have to re-build Tirdad from sources.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Tirdad reconfiguration is not easily doable, will it work normally with the vanilla amd64 headers while using the FSF GNU kernel?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>From a debian-11-minimal I created the following templates:<br>
<code>ks-16-firefox</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">debian-11-minimal ---&gt; ks-16-minimal ---&gt; ks-16-firefox
</code></pre>
<p><code>debian-11-firefox</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">debian-11-minimal ---&gt; debian-11-firefox
</code></pre>
<p>The <strong>only</strong> difference between these two templates are the following packages:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">hardened-malloc
haveged
jitterentropy-rngd
kicksecure-qubes-cli
security-misc
</code></pre>
<p>The other packages, including <code>qubes-u2f</code>, have been installed in both templates.</p>
<p>For practicality, I then created a DispVM Template for <code>debian-11-firefox</code> and another for <code>ks-16-firefox</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that if I launch <code>firefox-esr</code> in a DispVM based off of <code>ks-16-firefox</code>, u2f authentication with a yubikey doesn’t work. However, with the same settings and website, everything works fine in the DispVM based off of <code>debian-11-firefox</code>.</p>

          <title>Degree of anonymity Kicksecure vs Whonix on Qubes-OS</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[iymsp]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Qubes</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi. I am using Qubes 4.1.1 together with Kicksecure and Whonix.</p>
<p>For the last few days and in general for the last half year, I’ve been actively studying the Whonix, Kicksecure and Qubes wiki. I’m testing all installations on a test station, at the moment I’m testing all Qubes on Debian-minimal + Kicksecure-16.</p>
<p>The Whonix and Kicksecure wiki says that by hacking the AppVM an attacker can correlate between other virtual machines hacked now or much earlier. And in that case I wonder, is it anonymous to use Kicksecure for example for vlc, xmpp instead of Whonix?</p>
<p>I’m strengthening my templates as <a href="http://www.dds6qkxpwdeubwucdiaord2xgbbeyds25rbsgr73tbfpqpt4a6vjwsyd.onion/wiki/System_Hardening_Checklist" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">recommended</a> by the wiki: LKRG, Tirdad, Hardened Malloc, Hidepid, Apparmor, Security-Misc, SUID Disabler and Permission Hardener and I also disable the root account.<br>
As far as I understand it will make it a bit difficult to correlate between the hacked virtual machines, but still CPUID, CPU temperature, SSD/HDD.</p>
<p>Bottom line: Would it make sense to use copies of whonix-ws-16 for simple programs such as Liferea, vlc, xmpp instead of the minimal debian templates fortified by kicksecure and along with implemented recommendations from the wiki, like LKRG, Tirdad, etc.<br>
After all, kicksecure does not change the system name to host, and there is no whonix-firewall, does that mean it’s more anonymous to use whonix-ws-16?<br>
Separately I would like to mention proprietary programs, should they be used in Whonix if necessary ? Even when Zoom is run as User, it still sees the MAC which is the same for all virtual machines and also sees the hostname which is not changed to Host in kicksecure.<br>
But as far as I understand using many minimal templates fortified by kicksecure and together with the implemented recommendations from the wiki, on the type of LKRG, Tirdad, etc. Much better in terms of attack surface. But on the above reflection I’m having a hard time choosing.</p>
<p>A rough scheme of what I mean:<br>
<em>1) Qubes together with Kicksecure fortifications</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-net</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-firewall</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-usb</li>
<li>( ! ) kicksec-16-min-xmpp = xmpp-personal</li>
<li>( ! ) kicksec-16-min-zoom = zoom-work</li>
<li>whonix-ws-16 = anon-whonix</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><em>2) Qubes together with Whonix and Kicksecure:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-net</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-firewall</li>
<li>kicksec-16-min = sys-usb</li>
<li>( ! ) whonix-ws-16-xmpp = xmpp-personal</li>
<li>( ! ) whonix-ws-16-zoom = zoom-work</li>
<li>whonix-ws-16 = anon-whonix</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Will scheme 2 prevent virtual machine-to-virtual-machine correlation in case of hacking or proprietary software usage, or will it not help much and scheme 1 will be more efficient?</p>
<p>I am asking this question on Kicksecure as this question is more about Kicksecure and its advantages in terms of minimal templates.</p>
<p>I am grateful in advance and willing to listen to different views and opinions on these schemes of using Qubes together Whonix and Kicksecure.</p>
