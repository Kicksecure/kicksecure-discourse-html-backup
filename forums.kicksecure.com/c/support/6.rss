          <title>Systemd Service Hardening?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was learning about the options for Systemd services for restricting or in another word “hardening” services.</p>
<p>This made me question does Kicksecure deploy certain hardening for it’s services or certain Kicksecure specific services?</p>
<p>These are some interesting options I will note here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateNetwork=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives the service its own network namespace. It can’t see or use the host’s network interfaces unless you explicitly bind sockets. Seems useful to prevent leaks or prevent services from being ran without networking?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivatePIDs=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivatePIDs=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives a service an isolated view of the process table, which is a useful “defense in depth” measure, especially for daemons that don’t need to inspect or manage other system processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateTmp=yes/no</code></a><br>
Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp for the service, isolating it from the host’s temporary directories. One service can’t read temporary files left by another service, which mitigates attacks that rely on guessing or stealing temp‑file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#MemoryDenyWriteExecute=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes/no</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service. (helps mitigate code‑injection attacks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>ProtectSystem=full/strict/yes</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service.</p>
<p>There is many others but these few caught my eye.</p>

            <p>There is no .desktop file provided and putting /usr/bin/mulvadbrowser into a .desktop file also does not seem to work properly.</p>
<p>Only usable way is launching it in a terminal first then basing a dispvm on top of that appvm to use the generated .desktop file. But updating like that is a pain.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! I am not sure if this the best place to post this, so if it is not, sorry in advance.</p>
<p>I am trying to configure reticulum which is a new kind of decentralized network and it auto connects over IPv6 to other nodes on the network.</p>
<p>When I checked if IPv6 was enabled in Kicksecure, it says it is not.</p>
<p>Reading the docs, I found this on the DNS security page:<br>
/wiki/DNS_Security</p>
<p>" * The user’s computer has a local IPv6 but no actual IPv6 connectivity which might confuse DNS resolvers such as <code>unbound</code>."</p>
<p>My question is: is it safe to enable IPv6?</p>
<p>Why is turned off by default, and should I take any additional security/privacy measures if I decide to enable it?</p>

          <title>About new Kernel</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[InTheAir]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I’m installing kicksecure in a new laptop. The network wasn’t working and I’ve tried installing drivers but no luck. The only thing that has worked is installing a different version of the kernel and now the wifi is working fine.</p>
<p>For the installation of the new kernel I’ve followed this:<br>
kicksecure(.)com/wiki/Kernel#Package_Installation</p>
<p>Now this command <code>uname -r</code> give me this: <code>6.12.38+deb12-amd64</code></p>
<p>The questions:<br>
Is this system secure or is more vulnerable?<br>
When kicksecure will use this kernel in the stable repository?<br>
Should I now remove this file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list ?<br>
I think not, but I guess that I should remove it only when the kernel I need is in the stable repository…</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>Live mode option boots into persistent sysmaint</title>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I updated my Whonix Gateway (VirtualBox) today and upon rebooting, Live mode was no longer an option to choose from.</p>
<p>I took a look at the /etc/grub.d/10_20_linux_live to see if I could spot anything that might’ve broken, but I didn’t notice anything wrong.</p>
<p>I decided to start fresh by importing the .ova file for the newest version (17.4.4.6, stable). However, upon booting and performing an update in system maintenance mode, trying to reboot and choose the Live User Session mode seems to open System Maintenance mode with persistence each time.</p>
<p>I’ve already deleted my old appliance for this fresh copy of the gateway and workstation. I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m not a developer or power user, but if there is any way I can help to figure out what’s happened, please advise.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Jake</p>
<p>EDIT:  Have tried a reinstall of grub-live (‘sudo apt install --reinstall --no-install-recommends grub-live’) but no improvement, it still boots into Sysmaint with persistence when choosing Live User Session.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: **Adding here for others reference, it was actually booting into Live mode as arraybolt3 explains in their response, I just got confused by the system maintenance panel showing on boot and had expected to see the word Live in the top right. **</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>Can anyone help, with why my VM’s show this error on boot?<br>
Everything works as expected though, except, but might not be related, many reboots hang on the “Invalid DMI field header” and I have to reset/stop-start the VM.<br>
</p><div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/49a61e63cbe03d7de7eafa43c178b1706859401e.png" data-download-href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/49a61e63cbe03d7de7eafa43c178b1706859401e" title="image"><img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/49a61e63cbe03d7de7eafa43c178b1706859401e.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="avwLj7luISzYzWqaK9ep4hO5EK2" width="690" height="438" data-dominant-color="050505"></a></div><p></p>
<p>Running VirtualBox on Windows 11.<br>
Guest OS is newest Kicksecure/whonix</p>
<p>Please let me know what info I can provide. I still new to Linux troubleshooting, so not sure what makes sense to post as info.</p>
<p>[EDIT]<br>
I noticed the Swap file notice, and have since given the VM more memory.<br>
The info is gone, but the error is still present.<br>
[/EDIT]</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Nvidia GPU drivers (non free)<br>
I’m currently using arch based endeavourOS distro and it’s very convenient in terms of I don’t really need to worry about the installation of Nvidia drivers.<br>
I tried to use debian and couldn’t/didn’t want to invest so much energy and time just to install a driver.<br>
How is the installation process of Nvidia drivers on kicksecure?</p>
</li>

<p>I’m using plasma 6 and couldn’t find if kicksecure switched to plasma 6 or not</p>

            <p>Just wanted to post this here for other users that may using keepassxc with TOTP and it failing to spit out correct codes related to sdwdate issue bellow.</p>
<p>I went to set up TOTP inside keepassxc and it kept failing to give the right codes. This led me to figure out that the time has to be correct for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Since I was using a VPN auto connect it would sometimes cause sdwdate to time out due to [VPN → Tor → sdwdate] slow connection or whatnot.</p>
<p>Once I synced sdwdate the issue was resolved.</p>

            <p>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:</p>
<p>dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory</p>
<p>reboot: system halted</p>
<p>From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)<br>
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</p>

            <p>Dear developers,</p>
<p>Debian, of course, is a very good OS.<br>
But unfortunately, it and its core contain blobs and proprietary firmwares.</p>
<p>Why don’t you switch to PureOS instead of Debian to improve the security of Kicksecure?<br>
Project PureOS has an exceptionally clean kernel and no proprietary firmwares and drivers (and even an open BIOS).</p>

<pre><code class="lang-auto">PROXY_IP=192.168.7.70
PROXY_PORT=9050
</code></pre>
<p>And have the error (<em>Tor’s Control Port could not be reached</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% sudo journalctl -fu sdwdate

...
</code></pre>
<p>Sdwdate is still running, but <strong>there is no time synchronization</strong>, no any success line in log, like this one:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">...

...
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Is it possible to use sdwdate without Tor Control Port?</strong></p>

Or i could keep using my good old bash script for time synchronization behind a proxy as a temporary forced alternative?: <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/use-sdwdate-without-tor-control-port/1116/1">(click for more details)</a>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>On my Dell Laptop it has a handy hardware WiFi Switch on the side that when switched/toggled it disables all Wireless (WWAN/WLAN/Bluetooth).</p>
<p>When booted from Live ISO (USB) on USER session or SYSMAINT session if I then go to toggle the WiFi switch to disable wireless at any given time it causes the system to permanently freeze. This is regardless if I connect to network first or not before toggling the switch.</p>
<p>To my knowledge Dell Laptops that are in the “Enterprise” category only come with these hardware style WiFi switches or these are just the ones that I have seen. I’m not sure about other brands but it’s nice for the obvious security reasons to disable wireless if you don’t need or are using wired Ethernet connection specifically as I’m doing.</p>
<p>Also why is <code>rfkill</code> not a included as a package or prepackages with the ISO?</p>

            <p>So you prefer using the .img format for persistence and ease of file creation.</p>
<p>Is it possible that a persistent Kick image is available.</p>

            <p>Could UEFI/BIOS exploits/rootkits be a potential source of compromise?</p>
<p>Is there an API that is capable of briding the firmware(BIOS/UEFI) with an OS,</p>
<p>or a Hypervisor?</p>
<p>Is there a list of firmware exploit kits that allow for this type of API?</p>
<p>Is it possible to PXE boot a bootkit/rootkit, or an RTOS remotely?</p>
<p>Could this be done using something like IntelME?</p>
<p>Which network protocol/service would be used in this case?</p>
<p>Would this networking protocol be wired or wireless?</p>
