          <title>How to delete command line history?</title>

            <p>Hi All, I’m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use <code>history -c &amp;&amp; history -w</code>. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn’t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.</p>
<p>These “Apps” should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</p>

In all other VMs i change the ipv4 to manual<br>

            <p>I want to follow this tutorial:<br>
monero (dot) how/tutorial-how-to-speed-up-initial-blockchain-sync<br>
So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there</p>
<p>However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.<br>
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?</p>
<p>Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</p>

            <p>Is there anyway to prevent or “blacklist” certain packages from being installed?<br>
I tried creating a preferences file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist</code> to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
</code></pre>
<p>However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true?</p>
<p>If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</p>

            <p>Hi guys. I am using Kicksecure on a virtual machine. Host is ubuntu. I really like ubuntu. in the documentation you say Kicksecure used to work on ubuntu, but you chose debian because of potential problems with canonical. in the documentation you say grub-live can work on ubuntu /wiki/Grub-live#Compatibility, but I tried installing it on ubuntu, mint 22 and kubuntu and grub menu item does not appear. please help me what I should change in code to make it work on ubuntu. I would like to be able to run live mode for the whole system. this could be an additional defense for those using Kicksecure on an ubuntu host. thank you</p>

            <p>Apologies, I accidentally posted on Whonix Forums.</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to get Wayland working with Kicksecure/KVM.</p>
<p>Installing a Wayland compositor like sway or labwc in XFCE Kicksecure is not an option, due to the qemu bug which rotates the cursor by 180 degress. This happens with any DE that doesn’t fully integrate Wayland. (sway issue <span class="hashtag-raw">#6581</span> on git)</p>
<p>Using Kicksecure with LXQT or KDE which have native Wayland support fixes that issue. (already tested with CLI Version)</p>
<p>Can I simply replace or add a few packages in Derivative-Maker to achieve this?</p>
<p>Looks like <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>, lists the following meta-packages and their dependencies (containing all xfce packages) which could be changed to install LXQT instead of XFCE:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kicksecure-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce
kicksecure-shared-host-xfce
.......etc
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfce4 &gt; lxqt
mousepad &gt; featherpad
xfce4-terminal &gt; qterminal
....etc
</code></pre>
<p>After some more digging the variable <code>dist_build_script_build_dependency</code> in <code>build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine</code> contains all the packages listed in <code>kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>.</p>
<p>I keep seeing <code>"$@"</code> in  <code>3500_install-packages</code> later on, so I’m assuming some of the packages are passed as an argument to the install functions.</p>
<p>My plan would be to either switch the xfce packages to lxqt in <code>/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code> or if that’s no good then sed replace them in the variable that holds all install dependencies.</p>
<p>Finally, config stuff seems to be handled by <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/desktop-config-dist</code>. There I’d just replace <code>/etc/skel/.config</code> xmls with lxqt ones.</p>
<p>Is that pretty much it or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</p>
<p>We should consider adding Virtualbox to Kicksecure by default, maybe only for Kicksecure Live USB at least (virtualbox is there before installation, but not after, to reduce attack surface). This will make possible to run any virtual machines from a plausibly-deniable external drive without leaving a trace on the computer. This also helps to reduce attack surface for the host os (kicksecure live usb), as it is amnesic and it is harder for malware to persist, especially with physical write-protection switch enabled.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Live USB → Virtualbox/KVM → Whonix VM/other OS.</p>
<p>Something like this could be done if Kicksecure was installed on the usb drive and the virtualbox installed on it manually, and after that user must be careful to launch live-mode only every time. But this is not as plausibly-deniable as a plain Kicksecure installation media, and it is obvious that Virtualbox was installed there for a reason. If every Kicksecure installation out there contained Virtualbox by default, it would be impossible for an attacker to claim that someone installed virtualisation software for a purpose of hiding something.</p>
<p>Essentially I am talking about something like HiddenVM mod for TAILS but with proper hardened nature of Kicksecure.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, at least we should consider creating a wiki-guide with information on how to add Virtualbox in Kicksecure Live Installation USB manually.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>If Whonix is an extension of Tor Browser, I want Kicksecure as an extension of Mullvad Browser.</p>
<p>I don’t need Tor networking, but I would like to hide my timezone and hostname, etc. Are there simple packages from Whonix that can be installed to hide it in Kicksecure?</p>
<p>Is it ‘anon-ws-base-files’?</p>

            <p>Woke up one morning with the laptop on my chest. To get Tor rocking I tried to set manually sdwdate clock like I always do, because the CMOS battery is done or something else is off since replacing the battery didint make any difference.</p>
<p>Anyway got <strong>ERROR: Login blocked after 50 attempts</strong>. Followed unlocking instructions from Unlock User Account: Excessive Wrong Password Entry Attempts on Safely Use Root Commands page.</p>
<p>Booted in to a recovery mode in GRUB/BIOS advanced options for … something.<br>
Run the      <strong>faillock --user user --reset</strong>     in the maintenance state/mode.<br>
Went back to regular kicksecure and sudo/login pw was still locked.<br>
Tried several times back and forth with no avail.<br>
Also tried only <strong>faillock</strong> command which should show list of login attempts.<br>
It told me:  <strong>faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</strong><br>
Tried  <strong>which faillock</strong>  it told me the path to faillock, so it seems to be existing anyway.</p>
<p>To clarify I can get to desktop by turning on laptop since there is only encryption password prompt, but cant do anything sudo and if I let it idle too long the login prompt comes up and I have to reboot to get back, though I could maybe remove hibernation or whatever it is that triggers login prompt.</p>
<p>Printed all that internets had about it. Havent tried other stuff yet. Many point towards creating/touching such a directory. Dont know if I should follow strangers advice to touch hidden places. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>Still wondering how it got locked. Is it even possible to fall a sleep with hands on keyboard on such a position that the user login prompt gets saturated? Will it accept continous enter as a attempt?</p>

<p>(<strong>KickSecure</strong> / <strong>Whonix</strong>) are both solid choices when it comes to (privacy &amp; security) for a system with low (specs. CPU, RandomAccessMemory &amp; Storage). While <strong>Whonix-Host</strong> is still under heavy development and not available yet to the public, ‘sitting’ with <strong>KS</strong> is the best course of action to be taken.</p>
<p>To experiment, I’ve decided to <em>route specific site to <strong>TheOnionRouter</strong> via PAC’s script on NetworkManager</em> which it doesn’t seems to route correctly. Extensive research had been carried out by me and <em>no (resolution, resources) regarding the issue have been found</em> as of writing.</p>

            <p>I just installed Kicksecure but I can’t get sound, not even when I plug in headphones to the audio jack. The Volume Control doesn’t show any output devices besides the dummy output but my laptop’s speakers worked with Windows and the monitor that it’s plugged into via HDMI also has speakers which have been tested working with Qubes OS 4.2 and Fedora Workstation 41. How can I get the audio to work? Any help is much appreciated!</p>
