<li>Kicksecure in live mode as Host OS, but as dualboot on second SSD (first SSD and boot for public use)</li>
<li>Kicksecure in live mode through USB (can be with physical write-protection if possible)</li>
<li>Kicksecure in live mode on external SSD<br>
I want to somehow do so i have in one main os windows for aaa gaming and public use, but in other os Kicksecure for private use in which i will be able to host whonix vm’s through kvm for sensitive use.<br>
Which option will be best in this situation, maybe you have better solution?</li>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>

<p>Untrusted sites, anonymity tasks will done only on VM .</p>
<p>Must be apt torify deactivated to bypass bot flags on explorer?</p>
<p>Can the whole host system trigger bot on email and banking sites and such .</p>
<p>Any downside to use all above on VM instead of Host</p>

            <p>Kicksecure initates Tor connections by default to check for updates and download updates etc.</p>
<p>Is it dangerous to have Kicksecure active 24/7 even when not using it actively as state actors could potentially correlate connection patterns to deanonymize you?</p>
<p>Or is it even more dangerous to shutdown your Kicksecure device when not actively using it as they could correlate your Tor connections with your real life patterns, e.g. you shut down Kicksecure when leaving your physical location with your personal mobile device which is linked to your identity?</p>
<p>I am aware of this is an anoymity question and this is not a target of Kicksecure but related to Kicksecure.</p>

          <title>Systemd Service Hardening?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was learning about the options for Systemd services for restricting or in another word “hardening” services.</p>
<p>This made me question does Kicksecure deploy certain hardening for it’s services or certain Kicksecure specific services?</p>
<p>These are some interesting options I will note here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateNetwork=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateNetwork=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives the service its own network namespace. It can’t see or use the host’s network interfaces unless you explicitly bind sockets. Seems useful to prevent leaks or prevent services from being ran without networking?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivatePIDs=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivatePIDs=yes/no</code></a><br>
Gives a service an isolated view of the process table, which is a useful “defense in depth” measure, especially for daemons that don’t need to inspect or manage other system processes.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#PrivateTmp=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>PrivateTmp=yes/no</code></a><br>
Provides a private /tmp and /var/tmp for the service, isolating it from the host’s temporary directories. One service can’t read temporary files left by another service, which mitigates attacks that rely on guessing or stealing temp‑file names.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#MemoryDenyWriteExecute=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>MemoryDenyWriteExecute=yes/no</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service. (helps mitigate code‑injection attacks).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.exec.html#ProtectSystem=" rel="noopener nofollow ugc"><code>ProtectSystem=full/strict/yes</code></a><br>
Remounts parts of the filesystem read‑only (or makes the whole tree read‑only) for the service.</p>
<p>There is many others but these few caught my eye.</p>

            <p>Hey everyone! I am not sure if this the best place to post this, so if it is not, sorry in advance.</p>
<p>I am trying to configure reticulum which is a new kind of decentralized network and it auto connects over IPv6 to other nodes on the network.</p>
<p>When I checked if IPv6 was enabled in Kicksecure, it says it is not.</p>
<p>Reading the docs, I found this on the DNS security page:<br>
/wiki/DNS_Security</p>
<p>" * The user’s computer has a local IPv6 but no actual IPv6 connectivity which might confuse DNS resolvers such as <code>unbound</code>."</p>
<p>My question is: is it safe to enable IPv6?</p>
<p>Why is turned off by default, and should I take any additional security/privacy measures if I decide to enable it?</p>

            <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I’m installing kicksecure in a new laptop. The network wasn’t working and I’ve tried installing drivers but no luck. The only thing that has worked is installing a different version of the kernel and now the wifi is working fine.</p>
<p>For the installation of the new kernel I’ve followed this:<br>
kicksecure(.)com/wiki/Kernel#Package_Installation</p>
<p>Now this command <code>uname -r</code> give me this: <code>6.12.38+deb12-amd64</code></p>
<p>The questions:<br>
Is this system secure or is more vulnerable?<br>
When kicksecure will use this kernel in the stable repository?<br>
Should I now remove this file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list ?<br>
I think not, but I guess that I should remove it only when the kernel I need is in the stable repository…</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>Live mode option boots into persistent sysmaint</title>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I updated my Whonix Gateway (VirtualBox) today and upon rebooting, Live mode was no longer an option to choose from.</p>
<p>I took a look at the /etc/grub.d/10_20_linux_live to see if I could spot anything that might’ve broken, but I didn’t notice anything wrong.</p>
<p>I decided to start fresh by importing the .ova file for the newest version (17.4.4.6, stable). However, upon booting and performing an update in system maintenance mode, trying to reboot and choose the Live User Session mode seems to open System Maintenance mode with persistence each time.</p>
<p>I’ve already deleted my old appliance for this fresh copy of the gateway and workstation. I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m not a developer or power user, but if there is any way I can help to figure out what’s happened, please advise.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Jake</p>
<p>EDIT:  Have tried a reinstall of grub-live (‘sudo apt install --reinstall --no-install-recommends grub-live’) but no improvement, it still boots into Sysmaint with persistence when choosing Live User Session.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: **Adding here for others reference, it was actually booting into Live mode as arraybolt3 explains in their response, I just got confused by the system maintenance panel showing on boot and had expected to see the word Live in the top right. **</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Nvidia GPU drivers (non free)<br>
I’m currently using arch based endeavourOS distro and it’s very convenient in terms of I don’t really need to worry about the installation of Nvidia drivers.<br>
I tried to use debian and couldn’t/didn’t want to invest so much energy and time just to install a driver.<br>
How is the installation process of Nvidia drivers on kicksecure?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m using plasma 6 and couldn’t find if kicksecure switched to plasma 6 or not</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks</p>

          <title>TOTP based Authenticators fail if sdwdate is not synced</title>

            <p>Just wanted to post this here for other users that may using keepassxc with TOTP and it failing to spit out correct codes related to sdwdate issue bellow.</p>
<p>I went to set up TOTP inside keepassxc and it kept failing to give the right codes. This led me to figure out that the time has to be correct for it to work properly.</p>
<p>Since I was using a VPN auto connect it would sometimes cause sdwdate to time out due to [VPN → Tor → sdwdate] slow connection or whatnot.</p>
<p>Once I synced sdwdate the issue was resolved.</p>

          <title>Wrong FDE password 3 times - System Halted</title>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:</p>
<p>dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory</p>
<p>reboot: system halted</p>
<p>From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)<br>
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</p>
