            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>New to kicksecure. Clean install (nvidia 40xx series).</p>
<p>It uses VESA drivers, thus max res is 1200x<em>800. Got no options to change to 1920*1080 in display manager?!</em></p>
<p>Xrandr gives some errorcode with FAILED TO OUTPUT GAMMA something something. Display is not found “unknown display”.</p>
<p>How do I change to Nouveau? Do I need to enroll DKMS for the driver to load?</p>
<p>All other distros I have tried loads nouveau automatically and shows 1920*1080 in display manager.</p>
<p>This is in the HOST OS. Both in sysmaint and user, VESA driver loaded. Too low resolution for my eyes</p>

            <p>First post, genuine question</p>
<p>I come from Fedora and heard about KickSecure. It definitely piqued my curiosity. So I did a bare metal installation on an old Toshiba Satellite AMD4, UEFI &amp; Btrfs</p>
<p>I am trying to button down the sysmaint profile but keep finding obstacles. So I have reinstalled it twice. I’ve been using ChatGPT for help…. works 50% of the time when it’s not hallucinating</p>
<p>My question (and I have hundreds) can I get Mullvad VPN on Lockdown mode to connect before the ISP connects?</p>
<p>Just one idea I had</p>
<p>[Unit]<br>
Description=Override to enforce early Mullvad lockdown<br>
Before=network-pre.target network.target network-online.target<br>
Wants=network-pre.target</p>
<p>[Service]<br>
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/mullvad connect</p>
<p>But it failed</p>

          <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>

            <p>I don’t expect this to require any bug fix, unless one comes to mind, but just wanted to warn others of my ordeal.  Kicksecure seems an ideal OS for booting on a thumb drive for a very secure environment.  It seems more suitable than Tails for my use cases, as I’d also like to install some software to it.  To test it out, I burnt the live disk to a really OLD Kingston thumb drive of 8GB, and used it to install a persistent, encrypted thumb drive OS that I could e.g. install other softs on with SU privileges, a really old SanDisk 16 GB.  It booted and worked great.  I can even install other software by removing the split.</p>
<p>The Verbatim Seaglass drives seemed attractive, as they have lifetime warranties, which seems like a fairly strong expression of confidence in their shelf life.  I bought two 32GB and two 64, burnt the ISO on a Seaglass, and tried to boot it - this from the same ISO which previously worked.  It generated a bunch of errors and then said something like ‘Boot Failed’.  Note that virtual machines are enabled in both the BIOS’s I tried.  I then tried burning it without the extended volume name option in Rufus, and burnt onto a 64GB instead of a 32, and it worked.  I then plugged in the live disk in with another 64GB, and installed to it from Maint.  It seemed to complete quite happily, but it would not boot on any computer I tried it on, just like the first Live disk I originally burnt.  I compared it to the ancient SanDisk drive that worked.  I noticed in the boot order in the BIOS, I had a choice for the USB itself, and another for the same drive, with a Kicksecure name.  The one that started with USB wouldn’t boot, but the Kicksecure choice would.  Looking at two SeaGlass drives I tried to install to, neither show a Kicksecure choice in the BIOS.  It does not work with Secure Boot turned off.</p>
<p>These Seaglass drives SAY that they work for formatting in EXT4 on Linux.  I seem to have only one significant choice on how to create the installed version: EXT4 or BTFS.  I tried both on one of the drives, but neither gave me a Kicksecure boot choice.  I tried booting it on a port on a hub, and two different ports on my desktop.  No dice.</p>
<p>Based on the principle that if you try to install Windows on a machine, and you get errors instead of an OS, it is a virtual certainty that the HW is bad or incompatible  It seems like a foregone conclusion that the reason for the difference is the thumb drives; but feel free to make any suggestions.  I’ve had mostly good luck with Verbatim blank optical media over the years, but IMHO, this does not look good for them.  It seems like they are Kicksecure incompatible, as is.  I don’t know if it’s a bug in the design, M$ paid ‘em to be incompatible (which here seems unlikely, since they advertise Linux compatibility), or there’s a problem with USB 3.2 Gen 1; or maybe I’m missing something.  Maybe a bug in the KickSecure installer is more likely than Windows, but it seems less likely given that the prob. seems to show up depending on the thumb drive it’s installed on.  Implementing a thumb drive should under it all just be a big block of memory..</p>
<p>My machine is an ancient ASRock Tai Chi X570, with a Ryzen 5 3800X.  The SeaGlass USB drives are for USB 3.2 Gen 1.  This matches the specs on most of the USB ports on my desktop, AND on my USB hub.</p>

          <title>Noob questions VPN/Display resolution</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Fazeclan]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to install kicksecure, however before I connect to the internet id like to install a VPN. Managed to do it by entering Sysmaint, mount the usb, copy files to /media/ install the .deb file.</p>
<p>However, I have a question. Now that I have a VPN installed in sysmaint (and host user). Will all traffic be router by the vpn, even clearnet/APT upgrades?</p>
<p>Do I first need to launch the VPN in sysmaint - before updating packages/software for it to cover the APT traffic? ISP → VPN → Clearnet/Tor</p>
<p>Regarding the Display. I only get 1200x<em>800 in resolution, no other suggestions. I figured it is a driver issue</em>…? Linux Mint shows alot of resolutions per default. Not kicksecure. <em>Kicksecure is using MESA drivers and my display (1920 x 1080) is not found. I tried force set display with xrandr but doesnt work. Just throws error codes. How do I switch/change to Nouveau drivers? Or does it not having enrolled the secure boot key therefor preventing Nouveau drivers to load? I have read the nouveau drivers should be included in the linux mainkernel by default. My linux mint test-install showed indeed Nouveau drivers was in use.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind im a total noob to linux. Trying to make the switch to more secure software after having trouble with hacker attacks and malware in windows.</p>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I’m currently using endeavour os on two computers(one with additional nvidia GPU and the other one just with integrated intel’s). I like it mainly because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it never breaks(like after updates etc) and I used different ones before that(ubuntu, fedora, manjaro etc). This one I use on both computers like over 2 years now and with no issues.</li>
<li>for the nvidia GPU laptop I don’t need to think what to do each time something is not right etc. The drivers just work (I use the nvidia’s drivers the system suggest to install).</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT… despite I use hardened kernel, I know that kicksecure is probably way more secure and much more privacy respected system. That’s why I wanna switch, but the above two things are stopping me from it.</p>
<p>Can you please clarify the two points above, because I’m not really a techie and don’t wanna deal with all the under-stuff. I just want my system to just work and be as secure and private as possible.</p>
<p>I feel like when I’ll install it I’ll end up switching back because I will need to pull my hairs off again dealing with the nvidia GPU drivers or that some day after an update the system will not boot or something will not work and again I will pull my hairs off.</p>
<p>P.S: forgot to mention that I use KDE plasma and highly used to it, in case it matters somehow</p>

<p>My computer has HEADS/coreboot as bios and Qubes OS as main OS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately HEADS does not “see” Kicksecure and cannot launch it.</p>

            <p>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?</p>
<p>At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.</p>
<p>I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So I’m totally new to Kicksucure. I want to try it out and play around with it in a VM using Virt manager using Mint as the host OS. That way I can get a feel for it and download my apps.</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to figure out how to set a persistant VM though! Whenever I shutdown that VM then try to open it I get a black screen saying no bootable device found and have to delete and then spin up the VM again.</p>
<p>I have tried booting from a USB and still can’t figure out how to set a persistant mode. I would kinda like to use kicksecure as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>

            <p>Hi, this is my first post here,</p>
<p>I really love Kicksecure and Whonix, so thank you to all for providing this.</p>
<p>I was thinking of distromorphing kicksecure for a metal install and wanted to avoid systemd. As many researchers agree that it can be a  security issue.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to distromorph from Devuan?<br>
How many packages would need to be changed that rely on systemd?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p>

<p>Unable to locate package anbox<br>
zsh: exit 100   sudo apt install --no-install-recommends linux-image-amd64 linux-headers-amd6</p>
<p>Also the documentation says to install anonbox version 2018, is this project abandoned and no longer recommended?</p>
<p>I was planning to repeat the above instructions</p>

            <p>Any downside of using Kicksecure as host system compared to Debian for day to day use ( banking ,YouTube, etc)</p>
<p>Untrusted sites, anonymity tasks will done only on VM .</p>
<p>Must be apt torify deactivated to bypass bot flags on explorer?</p>
<p>Can the whole host system trigger bot on email and banking sites and such .</p>
<p>Any downside to use all above on VM instead of Host</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
