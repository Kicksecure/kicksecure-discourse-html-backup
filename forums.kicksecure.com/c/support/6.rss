            <p>hello,<br>
i want to report a problem and provide resolution for future folks to save their time and help people abroad as many people as possible to this system.</p>
<p>problem was that i had no sound after switching from Debian 13 to Kicksecure 18:</p>
<p>1)‘cat /proc/asound/cards’ outputs ‘— no soundcards —’</p>
<p>2)‘lspci -k -nn’ outputs correctly my audio card which is:<br>
Audio device [0403]: Intel Corporation Meteor Lake-P HD Audio Controller [8086:7e28] (rev 20)</p>
<p>3)sudo journalctl -b &gt; output.txt - reports error with not loading “sof-firmware” package</p>

          <title>Some default apps in K18 just can&#39;t work</title>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I’m a happy user of Kicksecure 17, but since major release 18 is out I feel a bit frustrated as some things that worked before simply don’t anymore.</p>
<p>Give you a couple of examples:</p>
<p>The system tools GParted and GSmartControl can’t work any more due to the higher privileges required.</p>
<p>Even after removing sysmaint account they don’t work. I do understand it’s related to privleap and Wayland, but unfortunately I am not skilled enough to find a way to ‘fix’ this.</p>
<p>I’m really concerned as my threat model also implies I use KVM in live mode host and ZuluCrypt, where both required higher privileges.</p>
<p>Any suggestion to make all these apps with higher privileges to work?</p>

          <title>Sdwdate broken after upgrade to Kicksecure 18: Missing SECCOMP syscalls (statx, fstatfs, epoll_pwait2)</title>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>After upgrading from Kicksecure 17 to 18 I noticed that <code>sdwdate</code> never finished syncing time. After checking the logs I found several lines similar to this,</p>
<p><code>SECCOMP auid=4294967295 uid=117 gid=130 ses=4294967295 subj=unconfined pid=6319 comm=“leaprun” exe=“/usr/bin/python3.13” sig=31 arch=c000003e syscall=332 compat=0 ip=0x7c87efbaf31a code=0x80000000</code></p>
<p>By following the instructions on <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Seccomp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Debugging Systemd Seccomp</a>, I figure out that syscalls 332 (statx), 138 (fstatfs) and 441 (epoll_pwait2) needed to be added to <code>SystemCallFilter=</code>. And indeed after doing that the issue was completely fixed. Architecture is x86_64.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is not the correct category, I wasn’t sure if I should post this on Support or Development.</p>

            <p>The question goes for whonix 17 also, but to put it mildly 18 needs a bit of polishing, the main thing is that i need copy paste and with the wayland bug on virtualbox I aint getting that. Also for some reason KVM slows down my machine to a craw.<br>
So the question is for how long will the 17.4.4.6 versions of whonix and kick be safe to use?</p>

          <title>Switch LXQT compositor/labwc settings?</title>

            <p>Hi, new Kicksecure user here. Before I continue, I want to say, thank you so much for this distro. This is amazing. This distro let me get what would have been weeks of work and plenty of holes from my knowledge gaps solved with a simple gui install. Between GrapheneOS and this, it’s amazing that we have tools that make some level of security <em>easy.</em></p>
<p>I’m fairly used to a traditional Linux desktop, where I have a window manager setup. Personally I would have loved if Kicksecure would provide a cli version to install on metal, but it seems the only option for that is morphing debian, which is not really what I want to do. I understand this is a low priority for most users, and obviously, the focus of this is security, not customization. That said, given this is LXQT, is there a way to access the settings of labwc and/or change the compositor to Sway (for tiling)? Some of my keyboard buttons (volume, most importantly)are not working, and I would like to add some keyboard shortcuts, but on Wayland, this needs to be done through the compositor, not LXQT. I couldn’t see any GUI settings for this, but I was pretty sure they existed (granted it has been a while since I last used LXQT). Have these been hidden for a security reason, or am I misremembering? Is there any way to change these safely?</p>

            <p>Hello Kicksecure,</p>
<p>Been a long time lurker since I started using whonix and really like debian and all that jazz.</p>
<p>So my question is whats the difference between grub live and a custom grub entry with <code>toram noswap nohibernate</code> flags?</p>
<p>Whats different with “grub live” or makes it different from a custom entry that has <code>toram noswap nohibernate</code> chosen and passed after selecting it in the bootloader?</p>
<p>Previously I installed grub-live on debian through the Kicksecure repo in the past out of curiosity it said I had swap enabled still which also confuses it me? That was like many months ago so I’m sure things have changed?</p>
<p>Is it some kind of compression swap like overlay like zram?</p>

sudo os-prober in mint does not find kicksecure.</p>

            <p>I installed the kicksecure 18 iso on an old laptop and wanted to lock the screen when the lid closes.</p>
<p>At first I received this warning message:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="plaintext"><code class="lang-plaintext">Refusing to lock screen, because current account 'user' has no password set.
If the screen was locked, it would automatically unlock the moment any user input was received. Please set a password to enable screen locking.
</code></pre>
<p>So I creating a password &amp; disabled auto-login for “user” in sysmaint.<br>
Now I can now lock the screen as “user”, but no matter what I type into sway lock I’m told the password in wrong.</p>
<p>I tried changing the “user” password to a single numerical digit in case it’s some sort of keyboard layout issue, but that didn’t work either.</p>
<p>Then I tried removing the “user“ password, re-enabled auto-login and manually ran the sway lock command from <code>/usr/bin/lock-screen</code> in qterminal:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="bash"><code class="lang-bash">swaylock --color 000000 --image /usr/share/kicksecure/lock-screen-background.png --scaling fit
</code></pre>
<p>That brings up sway lock, but no matter what I type it still won’t unlock (contrary to the prior warning message)</p>

            <p>I was following along on the kicksecure ram-wipe documentation for installing. and at the end it says:<br>
<em><strong>To wipe the LUKS full disk encryption (FDE) for the root disk from RAM it is required to unmount and root disk file system and close the root disk LUKS volume during the shutdown process.</strong></em></p>
<p>And thats where my issues arise. I installed the ram-wipe package to a Kali Linux VM, and the script works on shutdown. However it complains that there are still mounted encrypted disks.</p>
<p>How can you make it so that LUKS volumes get unmounted on shutdown so that ram wipe can do it’s thing?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>New to kicksecure. Clean install (nvidia 40xx series).</p>
<p>It uses VESA drivers, thus max res is 1200x<em>800. Got no options to change to 1920*1080 in display manager?!</em></p>
<p>Xrandr gives some errorcode with FAILED TO OUTPUT GAMMA something something. Display is not found “unknown display”.</p>
<p>How do I change to Nouveau? Do I need to enroll DKMS for the driver to load?</p>
<p>All other distros I have tried loads nouveau automatically and shows 1920*1080 in display manager.</p>
<p>This is in the HOST OS. Both in sysmaint and user, VESA driver loaded. Too low resolution for my eyes</p>

            <p>First post, genuine question</p>
<p>I come from Fedora and heard about KickSecure. It definitely piqued my curiosity. So I did a bare metal installation on an old Toshiba Satellite AMD4, UEFI &amp; Btrfs</p>
<p>I am trying to button down the sysmaint profile but keep finding obstacles. So I have reinstalled it twice. I’ve been using ChatGPT for help…. works 50% of the time when it’s not hallucinating</p>
<p>My question (and I have hundreds) can I get Mullvad VPN on Lockdown mode to connect before the ISP connects?</p>
<p>Just one idea I had</p>
<p>[Unit]<br>
Description=Override to enforce early Mullvad lockdown<br>
Before=network-pre.target network.target network-online.target<br>
Wants=network-pre.target</p>
<p>[Service]<br>
ExecStartPost=/usr/bin/mullvad connect</p>
<p>But it failed</p>

          <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Support</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I don’t expect this to require any bug fix, unless one comes to mind, but just wanted to warn others of my ordeal.  Kicksecure seems an ideal OS for booting on a thumb drive for a very secure environment.  It seems more suitable than Tails for my use cases, as I’d also like to install some software to it.  To test it out, I burnt the live disk to a really OLD Kingston thumb drive of 8GB, and used it to install a persistent, encrypted thumb drive OS that I could e.g. install other softs on with SU privileges, a really old SanDisk 16 GB.  It booted and worked great.  I can even install other software by removing the split.</p>
<p>The Verbatim Seaglass drives seemed attractive, as they have lifetime warranties, which seems like a fairly strong expression of confidence in their shelf life.  I bought two 32GB and two 64, burnt the ISO on a Seaglass, and tried to boot it - this from the same ISO which previously worked.  It generated a bunch of errors and then said something like ‘Boot Failed’.  Note that virtual machines are enabled in both the BIOS’s I tried.  I then tried burning it without the extended volume name option in Rufus, and burnt onto a 64GB instead of a 32, and it worked.  I then plugged in the live disk in with another 64GB, and installed to it from Maint.  It seemed to complete quite happily, but it would not boot on any computer I tried it on, just like the first Live disk I originally burnt.  I compared it to the ancient SanDisk drive that worked.  I noticed in the boot order in the BIOS, I had a choice for the USB itself, and another for the same drive, with a Kicksecure name.  The one that started with USB wouldn’t boot, but the Kicksecure choice would.  Looking at two SeaGlass drives I tried to install to, neither show a Kicksecure choice in the BIOS.  It does not work with Secure Boot turned off.</p>
<p>These Seaglass drives SAY that they work for formatting in EXT4 on Linux.  I seem to have only one significant choice on how to create the installed version: EXT4 or BTFS.  I tried both on one of the drives, but neither gave me a Kicksecure boot choice.  I tried booting it on a port on a hub, and two different ports on my desktop.  No dice.</p>
<p>Based on the principle that if you try to install Windows on a machine, and you get errors instead of an OS, it is a virtual certainty that the HW is bad or incompatible  It seems like a foregone conclusion that the reason for the difference is the thumb drives; but feel free to make any suggestions.  I’ve had mostly good luck with Verbatim blank optical media over the years, but IMHO, this does not look good for them.  It seems like they are Kicksecure incompatible, as is.  I don’t know if it’s a bug in the design, M$ paid ‘em to be incompatible (which here seems unlikely, since they advertise Linux compatibility), or there’s a problem with USB 3.2 Gen 1; or maybe I’m missing something.  Maybe a bug in the KickSecure installer is more likely than Windows, but it seems less likely given that the prob. seems to show up depending on the thumb drive it’s installed on.  Implementing a thumb drive should under it all just be a big block of memory..</p>
<p>My machine is an ancient ASRock Tai Chi X570, with a Ryzen 5 3800X.  The SeaGlass USB drives are for USB 3.2 Gen 1.  This matches the specs on most of the USB ports on my desktop, AND on my USB hub.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to install kicksecure, however before I connect to the internet id like to install a VPN. Managed to do it by entering Sysmaint, mount the usb, copy files to /media/ install the .deb file.</p>
<p>However, I have a question. Now that I have a VPN installed in sysmaint (and host user). Will all traffic be router by the vpn, even clearnet/APT upgrades?</p>
<p>Do I first need to launch the VPN in sysmaint - before updating packages/software for it to cover the APT traffic? ISP → VPN → Clearnet/Tor</p>
<p>Regarding the Display. I only get 1200x<em>800 in resolution, no other suggestions. I figured it is a driver issue</em>…? Linux Mint shows alot of resolutions per default. Not kicksecure. <em>Kicksecure is using MESA drivers and my display (1920 x 1080) is not found. I tried force set display with xrandr but doesnt work. Just throws error codes. How do I switch/change to Nouveau drivers? Or does it not having enrolled the secure boot key therefor preventing Nouveau drivers to load? I have read the nouveau drivers should be included in the linux mainkernel by default. My linux mint test-install showed indeed Nouveau drivers was in use.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind im a total noob to linux. Trying to make the switch to more secure software after having trouble with hacker attacks and malware in windows.</p>

            <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I’m currently using endeavour os on two computers(one with additional nvidia GPU and the other one just with integrated intel’s). I like it mainly because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it never breaks(like after updates etc) and I used different ones before that(ubuntu, fedora, manjaro etc). This one I use on both computers like over 2 years now and with no issues.</li>
<li>for the nvidia GPU laptop I don’t need to think what to do each time something is not right etc. The drivers just work (I use the nvidia’s drivers the system suggest to install).</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT… despite I use hardened kernel, I know that kicksecure is probably way more secure and much more privacy respected system. That’s why I wanna switch, but the above two things are stopping me from it.</p>
<p>Can you please clarify the two points above, because I’m not really a techie and don’t wanna deal with all the under-stuff. I just want my system to just work and be as secure and private as possible.</p>
<p>I feel like when I’ll install it I’ll end up switching back because I will need to pull my hairs off again dealing with the nvidia GPU drivers or that some day after an update the system will not boot or something will not work and again I will pull my hairs off.</p>
<p>P.S: forgot to mention that I use KDE plasma and highly used to it, in case it matters somehow</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The Snowflake extension in my firefox browser never show any counter, as it usually does in other OSs I use. It remains purple instead of being green. It’s like it is not working (whereas I activated it).</p>
<p>Is there some rule to give to my firewall ? Something I missed ?</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’m new to kicksecure, and I have questions to get it fit my everyday needs.</p>
<p>I can’t connect my android phone to the computer. Once plugged via USB wire, nothing happens, and nothing in Thunar nor in Gnome Disks.</p>
<p>Once plugged, my phone reacts :</p>
<ul>
<li>it charges</li>
<li>and asks me to choose a transfer mode</li>
</ul>
<p>Is there some packet missing on my install ? Or a config I didn’t do ?</p>
<p>Looking on the forum and on the internet didn’t give any help.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help</p>

          <title>Help with booting Kicksecure on HEADS (coreboot) bios</title>

            <p>Hello, this is my first post! <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>After playing with Kicksecure (template) on Qubes OS I tried to download the live iso and run it.</p>
<p>My computer has HEADS/coreboot as bios and Qubes OS as main OS.</p>
<p>Unfortunately HEADS does not “see” Kicksecure and cannot launch it.</p>
<p>The following github issue tracks the problem: <a href="https://github.com/linuxboot/heads/issues/2008" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">"kicksecure iso doesn't boot under Heads · Issue #2008 · linuxboot/heads · GitHub</a> .<br>
The main developer of HEADS ( <a href="https://github.com/tlaurion" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">tlaurion (Thierry Laurion) · GitHub</a> ) has replicated the issue. If you have any suggestion on how to fix it (or debug it), it would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>thank you in advance</p>

          <title>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections?</title>

            <p>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?</p>
<p>At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.</p>
<p>I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</p>

            <p>Hey everyone!</p>
<p>So I’m totally new to Kicksucure. I want to try it out and play around with it in a VM using Virt manager using Mint as the host OS. That way I can get a feel for it and download my apps.</p>
<p>I just can’t seem to figure out how to set a persistant VM though! Whenever I shutdown that VM then try to open it I get a black screen saying no bootable device found and have to delete and then spin up the VM again.</p>
<p>I have tried booting from a USB and still can’t figure out how to set a persistant mode. I would kinda like to use kicksecure as a daily driver.</p>
<p>Am I missing something?</p>
<p>Thanks for any and all help</p>
