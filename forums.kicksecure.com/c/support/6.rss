            <p>Hello Kicksecure folks,</p>
<p>I installed Debian on my brand new Western Digital external SSD drive. Then I proceeded to distro morph it following the guide (prob should have went with the ISO route) and everything works as intended.</p>
<p>However when I unplug my SSD or it comes unplugged somehow (has happened before) it doesn’t trigger a full shutdown?</p>
<p>Why doesn’t it fully shutdown when unplugged?<br>
I do want to add that also set up LUKS when I installed Debian.</p>
<p>Do I need to create a udev rule that runs a shutdown script (unmount, cryptsetup luksClose, and sync)?</p>

            <p>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It’s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, <a href="https://searchengine.party" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searchengine.party</a>, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users’ IP.<br>
Thank you for your work <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/heart.png?v=12" title=":heart:" class="emoji" alt=":heart:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>

          <title>How to use zulucrypt in USER Session?</title>

            <p>Hello. How to use zulucrypt in USER mode / USER live mode? I received an important encrypted secret steganographic container in messenger, but I could not open it due to sudo restrictions. I need to reboot, decrypt file, and then load again in USER mode / live mode to respond to interlocutor. This will be inconvenient (this can be a confidential important conversation where time is crucial - for example, if it is related to investigative journalism). What would you recommend in this case? Installing zulucrypt in Podman or Distrobox?</p>
<p>ps Live mode SYSMAINT is very good for viewing encrypted containers and do not save secret session to disk, when you are not limited by time</p>

            <p>Patrick, does it make sense to limit live mode for increased isolation in user-sysmaint-split, given that disk writing is limited? Live mode is very convenient for testing packages, new programs before installing in PERSISTENT mode. Often I try to install some program, but during installation, I encounter dependency problems, library version issues… as a result, package either doesn’t work or can disappoint me. And then it is very convenient to reboot. Rather than deleting everything I just installed + no traces of such experiments are left on disk</p>

            <p>I tried Kicksecure for the first time. I found that the terminal gave me sudo su (superuser) access without even asking for a password. A very simple privilege escalation hat lets me access the LUKS password from system memory. WTF? I  wanted to try Kicksecure because I saw that it would eventually become Whonix-Host. Is this is a bug?</p>

            <p>You can use Qubes OS the <em>secure OS</em> together with Whonix (anonymity). You can use Kicksecure the <em>security by default OS</em> with Whonix too through VirtualBox.</p>
<p>How should an user who is looking for security and anonymity decide between those operating systems?</p>
<p>The main advantage of Qubes OS is its isolated design. In combination with Whonix you have a gateway which enforces all traffic from all VMs going through Tor.</p>
<p>But you might use Kicksecure as your OS exclusively to start your VirtualBox instance and use Whonix from there for all your work or offline VMs. Kicksecure OS updates would go through Tor by default.</p>
<p>What are the drawbacks in such a setup for using Kicksecure compared with Qubes OS?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I morphed my Debian into Kicksecure on an old Macbook. Before, the optical drive worked fine, now it’s not recognized at all (“eject” and “lsblk” don’t list it).<br>
My understanding is that the kernel KS uses is the same as Debian, but I also found that some kernel drivers a blocklisted for security reasons (such as firewire because it would enable known exploits).<br>
The problem is that I rely on the optical drive. Is there any way to enable it?</p>
<p>Edit: I found this: /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf<br>
Any idea which one is needed for and Apple MacBook2,1 SuperDrive?</p>
<p>SOLVED: by commenting out these lines:<br>
blacklist cdrom<br>
blacklist sr_mod</p>
<p>in:<br>
/etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_blacklist.conf</p>
<p>EDIT:<br>
Also had to allow the udf filesystem.</p>

<p>is it possible to add a mount and launch virtual disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian.qcow2 (file itself is in /live/image) that it is launched in flows without consumption of additional memory? it will make a kicksecure a fantastically secure system (much cooler than qubes). live mode is perfectly launched by live-ISO, but how to avoid a load on memory with an already installed system, as is done with podman containers? solving this problem of memory load will help strengthen anti-forensicism. I use live mode every day, but even 32g of memory is not enough for working with VMs</p>

            <p>Hello lovely gentlemen, before I get going here I want to say a huge THANK YOU for selflessly automating so many good ideas in one place.</p>
<p>I’ve been unceremoniously digging into your wiki and general documentation, beginning (of course!) with a paradigm of Self Help <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating from GRUB to Systemd-Boot (formerly Gummiboot) and while the port has gone well, the kernel flag:</p>
<p>efi=disable_early_pci_dma</p>
<p>Works in GRUB, but prevents booting in systemd-boot.  Before I go blaming Mr. Poettering for his crimes against humanity (I jest) I wonder if the very intelligent people in this community - with years more experience in this platform than I - may have any thoughts on why this might be.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any insight, time, or just your thoughts.</p>
<p>PS: If you have any thoughts on UKI (Unified Kernel Images) and TPM bindings, I think I have a working layout but if perhaps there are gotchas to consider, or - and this is my greater fear - by switchinig out GRUB I may remove some hardening you have provided, I would certainly like to maintain all of that, and I would love a heads-up if I have wandered into a security minefield in my experimentations.  Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi All, I’m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use <code>history -c &amp;&amp; history -w</code>. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn’t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.</p>
<p>These “Apps” should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</p>

So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there</p>
<p>However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.<br>
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?</p>
<p>Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</p>

I tried creating a preferences file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist</code> to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
</code></pre>
<p>However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true?</p>
<p>If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</p>

            <p>Hi guys. I am using Kicksecure on a virtual machine. Host is ubuntu. I really like ubuntu. in the documentation you say Kicksecure used to work on ubuntu, but you chose debian because of potential problems with canonical. in the documentation you say grub-live can work on ubuntu /wiki/Grub-live#Compatibility, but I tried installing it on ubuntu, mint 22 and kubuntu and grub menu item does not appear. please help me what I should change in code to make it work on ubuntu. I would like to be able to run live mode for the whole system. this could be an additional defense for those using Kicksecure on an ubuntu host. thank you</p>
