          <title>Kde doesn&#39;t work correctly with Kicksecure 18</title>

            <p>Hi guys, active kicksecure user since more than 2 years.<br>
First of all thank you very much for all the job you do for support privacy, security and especially, for FOSS.</p>
<p>Basically my post is just for communicate and put on record in the forum, that for me, has been impossible to configure and run smoothly kde plasma 6 in kicksecure 18. I know has been some discussion about which desktop environment would be better for the security standards and that kde is not the best.<br>
But I like it.</p>
<p>I have 2 pcs, 1 laptop and 1 desktop. At the moment I was using kicksecure 17 in combination with kde without major problems. I installed kicksecure, kde, removed xfce4, and all worked fine in both devices.<br>
2 weeks ago I saw the new update to debian 13, what allowed me to use kde plasma 6, so I decided to upgrade to the new kicksecure version. In the laptop all has worked great, it’s a normal laptop without external gpu and stranger things.<br>
But for the desktop has been impossible to have kde and kicksecure 18 running well. I don’t know which could be the problem, maybe nvidia drivers, or some packets of kicksecure that broke the kde compositor.</p>
<p>I have tried to install kicksecure and later kde, install debian 13 and later kicksecure-cli version. Installing nvidia drivers, removing configurations. A lots of things. But at the moment I install kicksecure following the guide of the docs, kde stop working correctly. Problems in the compositor, win manager, crash on wayland sessions, and a fucking random orange and pink wallpaper that I don’t know where the hell it come from and I can’t remove it. XDDD</p>
<p>I have been more than 1 week trying to find the origin to all of these problems, but I’m just a casual linux user so couldn’t do too much.</p>
<p>I know kde is not supported in kicksecure but I have been using both of them correctly for more than 2 years. Maybe, I’m not sure, some packet or configuration is breaking kde. For me I’m going to come back to kicksecure 17 for the desktop because I’m used to kde and I can’t really work well without it.</p>
<p>Regards</p>

Not sure what sound backend is used and if they can be set globally to 50% instead of defaulting to 100%</p>
<p>The volume level should be set to 50 to avoid speaker blowout.</p>

            <h3><a name="p-4037-installation-details-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-4037-installation-details-1"></a>Installation Details</h3>
<hr>
<p>Version:           Kicksecure 18.0.8.7</p>
<p>Install medium:    Sandisk USB</p>
<p>Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted) + LUKS</p>
<p>Bios:		   Coreboot</p>
<hr>
<p>I’ll need to double check my notes, but the Syscheck notification popup error reports “FDE absent” when booting into Live Mode. My guess is that Live Mode running as a regular USER lacks the necessary privileges to perform the check. I selected FDE and selected LUKS at install. LUKS passphrase is still needed before I get anywhere, so it works. Luks was unlocked long before and I selected FDE in the installer and my files are decrypted so LUKS is present I would think?</p>
<p>Additionally, the Syscheck error notification can be quite annoying when operating in Live Mode as a USER. To get it to go away you have to mask it first in non Live Mode.<br>
I don’t mind it normally poping up for USER in normal mode but for Live Mode I could do without it tbh.</p>
<p>Would it even be possible to disable or mask the service for user in live mode (Not sysmaint), and would it make sense? Avoiding seeing after a new install after booting into user in live mode, while still showing it in normal session for user (they would still have the option to do systemctl --user mask updatecheck.service)</p>
<p>If we apply this would it also prevent the “Live Check Indicator” systray icon (the yellow circle) from appearing or is that unrelated to this?</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Ok, so I’m a TAILS OS user from wayback, but, as you all know, its not the most convenient ‘daily driver’ option, hence, I like the idea of KS/Whonix on a persistent USB.</p>
<p>To that end, has anyone manged to clone this configuration to a MicroSD card?</p>
<p>I have my ‘persistent’ TAILS OS on a 32GB MicroSD, which makes portable concealment that much easier.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>I can’t for the life of me workout how to adjust the keyboard backlight on my Intel MacBook Pro.</p>
<p>The “Keyboard &amp; Mouse” settings panel in KS is not an option because it is non-functional and the suggested workaround is beyond my pay grade at this early stage.</p>
<p>The actual keyboard ‘keys’ do nothing.</p>
<p>Tips and advice greatly appreciated.</p>

            <h3><a name="p-3989-installation-details-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3989-installation-details-1"></a>Installation Details</h3>
<hr>
<p>Version:           Kicksecure 17.4.4.6</p>
<p>Install medium:    Sandisk USB</p>
<p>Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted)</p>
<hr>
<p>I recall reading that the security‑misc profile disables the entire IPv6 stack. After installing, however, I verified that IPv6 is still active:<br>
Upon post install I checked and <code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6</code> returned 0 (enabled) and <code>ip -6 addr show</code> returned a inet6 address.</p>
<p>I had to create a config file <code>/etc/sysctl.d/99_disable-ipv6.conf</code> with these lines to disable it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
</code></pre>
<p>Upon further looking at the github README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Networking:</p>
<p>Optional - Disable the entire IPv6 stack to reduce attack surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it doesn’t point to the exact configuration file that implements this.</p>
<p>I’m not using this installation as a server, and I’m skeptical of the “IPv6 evangelism” that circulates in many networking sysadmin circles, not Kicksecure. My concerns stem mainly from two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv6 doesn’t provide the implicit NAT barrier that IPv4 does.</li>
<li>Privacy implications of EUI‑64 that can expose hardware identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So here are two questions about IPv6 and Kicksecure.</strong></p>
<h2><a name="p-3989-h-1-does-disabling-ipv6-reduce-tor-anonymity-set-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3989-h-1-does-disabling-ipv6-reduce-tor-anonymity-set-2"></a>1. Does Disabling IPv6 reduce Tor Anonymity set?</h2>
<p>Does disabling the IPv6 network stack on my machine then in return prevent the Tor Daemons from using IPv6 relays? (Reduced relay pool to select from)<br>
Will Tor only connect to IPv4 relays and ignore IPv6 relays?</p>
<h2><a name="p-3989-h-2-can-we-have-ipv6-privacy-extensions-enabled-without-breaking-root-dhcp-server-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3989-h-2-can-we-have-ipv6-privacy-extensions-enabled-without-breaking-root-dhcp-server-3"></a>2. Can we have IPv6 privacy extensions enabled without breaking root DHCP server?</h2>
<p>Can we enable full IPv6 (for Tor daemon’s IPv6 relay access and machine outbound) with privacy extensions, while maintaining a stable IPv6 address bound to your DHCPv6 server’s DUID for reliable client leasing and server reachability as to not add breakage for users needing the IPv6 server?</p>
<p><em>Config note here worth mentioning <code>man nm-settings-dbus</code></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The special values “llt” and “ll” will generate a DUID of type LLT or LL (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device.<br>
dhcp-duid=ll  # Fallbacks to link-local DUID for IPv6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is can we keep a stable, DUID derived address for server accessibility while also generating temporary privacy focused addresses for outbound traffic (Tor relay/daemon and general machine use like e.g. in a users post about reticulum use)?</p>

<p>This post is about what I believe to be called the Volume Manager plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>System volumes shown</li>
</ul>
<p>After install I noticed the “Removable Media” plugin on the lxqt panel in the upper right corner shows <code>/boot</code>, <code>/rootfs</code>, and <code>/efi</code> as mount points. Can the widget be told to ignore system or not show system volumes? I can see users accidentally unmounting these.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Removable Media” showing on center of desktop at boot</li>
</ul>
<p>After I booted I saw the panel plugin the center of screen as if it was a desktop icon but after like 5 seconds it disappeared. My guess is it is a bug with Wayland? Thought I would mention it.</p>

            <p>I’d like to break my feedback into separate posts, each covering a single topic, to keep things clear. First, I have to say I’m genuinely impressed with Kicksecure. Over the years I’ve written countless post install scripts just to harden a vanilla Debian installation. Despite trying several distributions, I always end up back at Debian. Only to be frustrated by its insecure defaults and the tedious manual hardening required. Literally editing config files till I go crazy lol. Kicksecure feels refreshingly different, the defaults are already security focused, which is fantastic. Kudos to the developers and the community!</p>
<h3><a name="p-3986-installation-details-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3986-installation-details-1"></a>Installation Details</h3>
<hr>
<p>Version:           Kicksecure 17.4.4.6</p>
<p>Install medium:    Sandisk USB</p>
<p>Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted)</p>
<hr>
<p>I flashed the ISO to one USB stick, then used a second USB as the target for the installation (for testing purposes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing “Etc/UTC” Timezone Option</li>
</ul>
<p>Under timezone there is no <code>Etc/UTC</code> which I really wanted to set and had to set after post install <code>timedatectl set-timezone "Etc/UTC"</code>. This isn’t really Kicksecures fault but a Calamares configuration issue. I believe this timezone is omitted or ignored in the default installer but I haven’t digged enough yet to see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can’t show LUKS password (LUKS Password Visibility)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is an installer side matter rather than a Kicksecure problem. While many installers (e.g., Ubuntu) let you toggle password visibility for user accounts, the Calamares stage that collects the LUKS passphrase lacks such a toggle. In a previous Debian install, long some time ago I entered the wrong LUKS password. I had to reinstall cause I was off on the keys I set for the LUKS password at this stage.</p>
<p>Is there a way to expose a “show password” option for the LUKS field in the Calamares configuration? If not, perhaps this could be proposed upstream to libkpmcore?</p>

            <ol>
<li>
<p>I cannot run swaylock. I am using a gb keyboard layout (kinda, I will explain after) and have swaylock installed. When trying to install from the system maintenance panel, it said “Refusing to lock screen, because the correct screen locker cannot be determined. The XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable must be set to ‘x11’ or ‘wayland’ to determine the proper screen locker to use. However, XDG_SESSION_TYPE is currently set to ‘tty’. Please report this bug!“ I ran “XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland”. Still doesn’t work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reason why I say I am kinda on gb is because I set gb in the install and it worked originally, but I think that after changing to kwin, it went to US, my /etc/vconsole.conf says gb, but it is still US.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what is said when I did the keyboard config option in configuration center and keyboard layout.<br>
00:00:00.000 [../src/main.c:72] LABWC_PID not set<br>
set_labwc_keymap: WARNING: ‘labwc --reconfigure’ reconfiguration failed!<br>

XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=gb<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=<br>
set_labwc_keymap: INFO: Configuration success.</p>
<p>Btw, the reason I changed to kwin instead of labwc, is because I really like having workspaces, but I couldn’t have workspaces without it. When I put desktop switcher in my pannel it shows “n/a”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>My trackpad isn’t working. I have no idea if this is because of kicksecure 18, but randomly it just stopped working, I was configuring kicksecure fine and my trackpad was working. (At this point swaylock worked) I went to do something, and when I came back it said someething along the lines of screenlock broken, go to terminal with ctrl+shift+f2. I shutdown, and after turning it on, my mouse didn’t move. I tried to reflash kicksecure and it still didn’t work, even during the install process and after too. I have been using a mouse plugged into my laptop. But I am sharing with my PC, this is really annoying.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would really appreciate some support, I can barely use my laptop right now. If I can go back to xfce, that would also work. Thanks.</p>

<p>Been trying to morph K18 on Trixie usb. Failed 4-5 times so far. Having fun though and learning stuff <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face.png?v=14" title=":grinning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Tried two different fast 1tb usbs, one with lvm encryption and one just lvm, no encryption. Used rufus and etcher.</p>
<p>Trixie installs every time with just lxqt and Debian desktop environment. I follow the guide add the repo manually as not in extrepo for Trixie, then I run into issues once I reboot after installing K18.</p>
<p>On first usb (A) bugs out after entering encryption password, asks for user login then fails to load lxqt and returns cli - don’t know how to start lxqt from cli. Or I run into lux swap file issue and no cli and no options. On second usb (B) K18 install failed as it couldn’t install security-misc and reported process error. Cli option to fix doesn’t fix. When I reboot it’s just into Trixie.</p>
<p>I’m trying to discount my Trixie install choices as a factor.</p>
<p>Question = Are there any dos/dont on the Trixie install which will screw up the k18 morph?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and any tips.</p>

            <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I’m a happy user of Kicksecure 17, but since major release 18 is out I feel a bit frustrated as some things that worked before simply don’t anymore.</p>
<p>Give you a couple of examples:</p>
<p>The system tools GParted and GSmartControl can’t work any more due to the higher privileges required.</p>
<p>Even after removing sysmaint account they don’t work. I do understand it’s related to privleap and Wayland, but unfortunately I am not skilled enough to find a way to ‘fix’ this.</p>
<p>I’m really concerned as my threat model also implies I use KVM in live mode host and ZuluCrypt, where both required higher privileges.</p>
<p>Any suggestion to make all these apps with higher privileges to work?</p>

          <title>Sdwdate broken after upgrade to Kicksecure 18: Missing SECCOMP syscalls (statx, fstatfs, epoll_pwait2)</title>

            <p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>After upgrading from Kicksecure 17 to 18 I noticed that <code>sdwdate</code> never finished syncing time. After checking the logs I found several lines similar to this,</p>
<p><code>SECCOMP auid=4294967295 uid=117 gid=130 ses=4294967295 subj=unconfined pid=6319 comm=“leaprun” exe=“/usr/bin/python3.13” sig=31 arch=c000003e syscall=332 compat=0 ip=0x7c87efbaf31a code=0x80000000</code></p>
<p>By following the instructions on <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Seccomp" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Debugging Systemd Seccomp</a>, I figure out that syscalls 332 (statx), 138 (fstatfs) and 441 (epoll_pwait2) needed to be added to <code>SystemCallFilter=</code>. And indeed after doing that the issue was completely fixed. Architecture is x86_64.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is not the correct category, I wasn’t sure if I should post this on Support or Development.</p>

          <title>For how long would it be safe to use 17.4.4.6?</title>

            <p>The question goes for whonix 17 also, but to put it mildly 18 needs a bit of polishing, the main thing is that i need copy paste and with the wayland bug on virtualbox I aint getting that. Also for some reason KVM slows down my machine to a craw.<br>
So the question is for how long will the 17.4.4.6 versions of whonix and kick be safe to use?</p>

          <title>Switch LXQT compositor/labwc settings?</title>

            <p>Hi, new Kicksecure user here. Before I continue, I want to say, thank you so much for this distro. This is amazing. This distro let me get what would have been weeks of work and plenty of holes from my knowledge gaps solved with a simple gui install. Between GrapheneOS and this, it’s amazing that we have tools that make some level of security <em>easy.</em></p>
<p>I’m fairly used to a traditional Linux desktop, where I have a window manager setup. Personally I would have loved if Kicksecure would provide a cli version to install on metal, but it seems the only option for that is morphing debian, which is not really what I want to do. I understand this is a low priority for most users, and obviously, the focus of this is security, not customization. That said, given this is LXQT, is there a way to access the settings of labwc and/or change the compositor to Sway (for tiling)? Some of my keyboard buttons (volume, most importantly)are not working, and I would like to add some keyboard shortcuts, but on Wayland, this needs to be done through the compositor, not LXQT. I couldn’t see any GUI settings for this, but I was pretty sure they existed (granted it has been a while since I last used LXQT). Have these been hidden for a security reason, or am I misremembering? Is there any way to change these safely?</p>
