            <p>Please help. I created snapshot in a timeshift. Then I wanted to change theme of grub-menu and updated grub - sudo update-grub, but live mode disappeared! I decided to make a backup in a timeshift, system was restored, but there is no live mode in grub! How can I restore live mode in grub-menu?</p>

            <p>Hello. in 90overlay-root creates /live/image file system for live mode</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh

# make a read-only nfsroot writeable by using overlayfs
# the nfsroot is already mounted to $NEWROOT
# add the parameter rootovl to the kernel, to activate this feature

. /lib/dracut-lib.sh

if ! getargbool 0 rootovl ; then
    return
fi

modprobe overlay

# a little bit tuning
mount -o remount,nolock,noatime $NEWROOT

# Move root
# --move does not always work. Google &gt;mount move "wrong fs"&lt; for
#     details
mkdir -p /live/image
mount --bind $NEWROOT /live/image
umount $NEWROOT

# Create tmpfs
mkdir /cow
mount -n -t tmpfs -o mode=0755 tmpfs /cow
mkdir /cow/work /cow/rw

# Merge both to new Filesystem
mount -t overlay -o noatime,lowerdir=/live/image,upperdir=/cow/rw,workdir=/cow/work,default_permissions overlay $NEWROOT

# Let filesystems survive pivot
mkdir -p $NEWROOT/live/cow
mkdir -p $NEWROOT/live/image
mount --bind /cow/rw $NEWROOT/live/cow
umount /cow
mount --bind /live/image $NEWROOT/live/image
umount /live/image
</code></pre>
<p>is it possible to add a mount and launch virtual disk /var/lib/libvirt/images/debian.qcow2 (file itself is in /live/image) that it is launched in flows without consumption of additional memory? it will make a kicksecure a fantastically secure system (much cooler than qubes). live mode is perfectly launched by live-ISO, but how to avoid a load on memory with an already installed system, as is done with podman containers? solving this problem of memory load will help strengthen anti-forensicism. I use live mode every day, but even 32g of memory is not enough for working with VMs</p>

            <p>Hello lovely gentlemen, before I get going here I want to say a huge THANK YOU for selflessly automating so many good ideas in one place.</p>
<p>I’ve been unceremoniously digging into your wiki and general documentation, beginning (of course!) with a paradigm of Self Help <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=12" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>I’m in the process of migrating from GRUB to Systemd-Boot (formerly Gummiboot) and while the port has gone well, the kernel flag:</p>
<p>efi=disable_early_pci_dma</p>
<p>Works in GRUB, but prevents booting in systemd-boot.  Before I go blaming Mr. Poettering for his crimes against humanity (I jest) I wonder if the very intelligent people in this community - with years more experience in this platform than I - may have any thoughts on why this might be.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for any insight, time, or just your thoughts.</p>
<p>PS: If you have any thoughts on UKI (Unified Kernel Images) and TPM bindings, I think I have a working layout but if perhaps there are gotchas to consider, or - and this is my greater fear - by switchinig out GRUB I may remove some hardening you have provided, I would certainly like to maintain all of that, and I would love a heads-up if I have wandered into a security minefield in my experimentations.  Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi All, I’m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use <code>history -c &amp;&amp; history -w</code>. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn’t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.</p>
<p>These “Apps” should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</p>

In all other VMs i change the ipv4 to manual<br>

And it works just fine, however when i do the same in a kicksecure VM…crickets.<br>
What am i doing wrong my duck search didnt provide any workarounds.</p>

            <p>I want to follow this tutorial:<br>
monero (dot) how/tutorial-how-to-speed-up-initial-blockchain-sync<br>
So i can download the blockchain over clearnet and import it into a monero client running on whonix VM and sync it there</p>
<p>However due to the fact that i want the kicksecure to be on a flashdrive i dont know how this should work.<br>
Should I try to download the blockchain on a hard drive then copy it on a flashdrive and copy it on the kicksecure flashdrive running in persistence mode?</p>
<p>Or would it possible to run the kicksecure flash in persistence, download the blockchain there, copy it into the whoniX VM and then sync it?</p>

            <p>Is there anyway to prevent or “blacklist” certain packages from being installed?<br>
I tried creating a preferences file <code>/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist</code> to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
</code></pre>
<p>However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true?</p>
<p>If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</p>

            <p>Hi guys. I am using Kicksecure on a virtual machine. Host is ubuntu. I really like ubuntu. in the documentation you say Kicksecure used to work on ubuntu, but you chose debian because of potential problems with canonical. in the documentation you say grub-live can work on ubuntu /wiki/Grub-live#Compatibility, but I tried installing it on ubuntu, mint 22 and kubuntu and grub menu item does not appear. please help me what I should change in code to make it work on ubuntu. I would like to be able to run live mode for the whole system. this could be an additional defense for those using Kicksecure on an ubuntu host. thank you</p>

            <p>Apologies, I accidentally posted on Whonix Forums.</p>
<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I’m trying to get Wayland working with Kicksecure/KVM.</p>
<p>Installing a Wayland compositor like sway or labwc in XFCE Kicksecure is not an option, due to the qemu bug which rotates the cursor by 180 degress. This happens with any DE that doesn’t fully integrate Wayland. (sway issue <span class="hashtag-raw">#6581</span> on git)</p>
<p>Using Kicksecure with LXQT or KDE which have native Wayland support fixes that issue. (already tested with CLI Version)</p>
<p>Can I simply replace or add a few packages in Derivative-Maker to achieve this?</p>
<p>Looks like <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>, lists the following meta-packages and their dependencies (containing all xfce packages) which could be changed to install LXQT instead of XFCE:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">kicksecure-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-applications-xfce
kicksecure-desktop-environment-essential-xfce
kicksecure-shared-host-xfce
.......etc
</code></pre>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">xfce4 &gt; lxqt
mousepad &gt; featherpad
xfce4-terminal &gt; qterminal
....etc
</code></pre>
<p>After some more digging the variable <code>dist_build_script_build_dependency</code> in <code>build-steps.d/1200_prepare-build-machine</code> contains all the packages listed in <code>kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code>.</p>
<p>I keep seeing <code>"$@"</code> in  <code>3500_install-packages</code> later on, so I’m assuming some of the packages are passed as an argument to the install functions.</p>
<p>My plan would be to either switch the xfce packages to lxqt in <code>/kicksecure/kicksecure-meta-packages/debian/control</code> or if that’s no good then sed replace them in the variable that holds all install dependencies.</p>
<p>Finally, config stuff seems to be handled by <code>derivative-maker/packages/kicksecure/desktop-config-dist</code>. There I’d just replace <code>/etc/skel/.config</code> xmls with lxqt ones.</p>
<p>Is that pretty much it or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>Virtualbox/KVM for Kicksecure Live</p>
<p>We should consider adding Virtualbox to Kicksecure by default, maybe only for Kicksecure Live USB at least (virtualbox is there before installation, but not after, to reduce attack surface). This will make possible to run any virtual machines from a plausibly-deniable external drive without leaving a trace on the computer. This also helps to reduce attack surface for the host os (kicksecure live usb), as it is amnesic and it is harder for malware to persist, especially with physical write-protection switch enabled.</p>
<p>Kicksecure Live USB → Virtualbox/KVM → Whonix VM/other OS.</p>
<p>Something like this could be done if Kicksecure was installed on the usb drive and the virtualbox installed on it manually, and after that user must be careful to launch live-mode only every time. But this is not as plausibly-deniable as a plain Kicksecure installation media, and it is obvious that Virtualbox was installed there for a reason. If every Kicksecure installation out there contained Virtualbox by default, it would be impossible for an attacker to claim that someone installed virtualisation software for a purpose of hiding something.</p>
<p>Essentially I am talking about something like HiddenVM mod for TAILS but with proper hardened nature of Kicksecure.</p>
<p>If that is not possible, at least we should consider creating a wiki-guide with information on how to add Virtualbox in Kicksecure Live Installation USB manually.</p>
