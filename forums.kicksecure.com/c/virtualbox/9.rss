            <p>I’ve used only Windows since the 80s, so my experience is limited. As I’ve learned about security I’ve become aware of the “Lack” thereof. Last couple of years I’ve been wanting to learn about Whonix which has a reputation for being Secure. However, I don’t know if I should keep the installation of Whonix as a goal in light of the interview with a Whistleblower US Gov’t IT specialist I heard the other night on a Podcast? He worded for US Gov’t in 2016 to a latter date. He became high ranking, and knowledgeable. He reports Microsoft as having the contract with all systems across the Federal Gov’t. He also reports he witnessed Microsoft Tech were ordered to act as “Escorts” to Chinese IT Tech personnel who were stationed in China. These “Escorts” supposedly acted as guides to allow access to the Chinese Tech on all levels? This will become very controversial since the President at the time (Obama) reportedly signed off on it. This is the background to my question since the Whistleblower also reported the “Escorts” also were used with Oracle! So, my question is was or is your Whonix product compromised, and/or is it now secure?</p>

            <p>I looked up site:virtualbox.org for more information on this error message and all I could find was a ticket from several years ago about windows. My host is Fedora because Debian and Qubes are not fully hardware compatible with Intel Alder Lake.<br>

<p>Sometimes VirtualBox works perfectly, and then–spontaneously–it does not and says Guru Meditation is required. Oracle will not allow me to sign up for an account. I do not know why. If someone* can get a support request link or knows the answer, do so or please tell.</p>
<p>(zip attached gzip - what part of the rest of the log is important?) . . . nope, forum doesn’t allow zip format</p>
