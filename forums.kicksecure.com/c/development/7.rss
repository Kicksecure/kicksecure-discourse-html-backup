            <p>Random idea that hit me while writing <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/usbguard-what-should-we-allow-or-disallow-by-default/1248/7:">https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/usbguard-what-should-we-allow-or-disallow-by-default/1248/7:</a> one potential threat vector for USB devices is if they provide a virtual Ethernet interface. This would allow the device to attack arbitrary services with open ports on the host. A firewall would help here (maybe, depends on whether it blocked the LAN or not), but what might help even more is if NetworkManager didn’t automatically connect the system to any wired network interfaces it sees.</p>
<p>Would it be desirable to turn off this wired autoconnect feature by default? Users could still use wired networks, they would just have to explicitly connect to them using the network management widget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One problem is that when you dual or multiboot, even if you are using encryption on your Qubes installation, /boot is still unprotected and could be maliciously modified by the other OS, possibly leading to Qubes itself being maliciously modified.</p>
<p>The other problem is firmware security - for example the other system could infect the BIOS firmware, which might enable compromise or spying on the Qubes system.</p>

          <title>USBGuard - what should we allow or disallow by default?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Kicksecure 18 is intended to ship USBGuard by default, with a configuration that should block likely-malicious, unknown, and unusual devices. The hope is that it won’t block so much as to significantly increase the difficulty of using Kicksecure, while also making it more difficult to use devices such as the Hak5 rubber ducky or O.MG plug (popular keystroke injection devices).</p>
<p>Our current USBGuard configuration is visible at <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">security-misc/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf at master · Kicksecure/security-misc · GitHub</a>. The original intent was to allow everything connected at boot, and then disallow everything other than mass storage devices, keyboards, and mice, while also not allowing keyboards or mice to be combined with other interfaces, and not allowing additional keyboards and mice to be attached if one is already present. However, as pointed out by Marek (the lead Qubes OS developer), this is going to cause <em>tons</em> of legitimate devices to be blocked: <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/commit/cba16879eff9d3d998c127e41c38d2067cdf04cc#r164474977" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Polish USBGuard configuration · Kicksecure/security-misc@cba1687 · GitHub</a></p>
<p>We have a pretty classic security vs. usability tradeoff here. We don’t want to block so much that users disable USBGuard because they can’t live with it, but we also don’t want to allow so much that malicious devices work in common configurations. It’s already risky enough allowing keyboards and mice to be attached after bootup, since if the only keyboard and mouse present on bootup is non-USB (as is the case with most laptops if you don’t plug additional devices into them), keystroke injection devices that present themselves as only a keyboard will be able to attack the system and succeed. But blocking <em>everything</em> other than keyboards, mice, and storage devices may be overkill also.</p>
<p>Does anyone have input on what should be blocked or not blocked by default? Some USB devices to think about here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcams
<ul>
<li>On its own, a webcam probably can’t cause too much trouble… the worst it could do is video the user on the user’s own machine, it would probably be much more useful for an attacker to record the user with an <em>attacker-controlled</em> machine, which of course USBGuard can’t do anything about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microphones
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headsets/speakers/miscellaneous other USB audio devices
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>Could introduce attack surface that we don’t want, see <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part I</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MIDI interfaces
<ul>
<li>Probably pretty rare, no idea what the risks are of allowing these to be used by default, would probably block them just in case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreens
<ul>
<li>Input device, similar to a mouse, might even be handled already by allowing mice in the system. Dangers are similar or identical to allowing mice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android devices
<ul>
<li>Uses or at least used to use Media Transfer Protocol. Unsure what the risks are here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USB Ethernet
<ul>
<li>Oftentimes uses RNDIS, which the Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman has tried to get disabled in Linux at least <em>three times</em> due to supposedly unfixable security issues. (<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024</a>) I would consider this very high-risk and would NOT enable it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bluetooth dongles
<ul>
<li>Could be used to attach arbitrary devices to systems remotely, but this would require some user interaction. Unsure what the implications of a malicious Bluetooth dongle would be. Internal Bluetooth cards actually use the USB bus, but they’ll be present on boot and thus allowed, if everything works as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2FA keys
<ul>
<li>I believe these present themselves as a human interface device, not sure how safe or unsafe this is or if it’s feasible to allow it by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else we should consider allowing or not allowing by default?</li>
</ul>

          <title>Sdwdate design enhancements</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not sure there’s much to discuss here, this is just me doing a brain-dump of my research so that it’s not lost and so that others can comment on it as desirable.</p>
<p>The current iteration of sdwdate does a pretty good job of keeping the system’s clock accurate but skewed just enough to provide better anonymity under Whonix. However, it has a few shortcomings we’d like to resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only sets the time for the (virtual) machine it runs on, it isn’t able to act as a server for helping other virtual machines running on the same system to also synchronize their time securely. This is something that would be nice to fix in Qubes OS, allowing sys-whonix (or more likely, sys-ops-whonix once that exists) to act as a master time-keeper for all VMs.</li>
<li>The current way it adjusts the clock is somewhat awful - it does a large clock jump or two to get the time close enough to accurate to allow connecting to Tor, then does a large number of small clock jumps to get the time to a final “good” value. Clock jump confuse software in multiple ways, and the small clock jumps we do currently can result in systemd journal being flooded, so they’re best avoided, and if they’re needed, it’s best to do one clock jump and then slew the clock to the correct time using something like <code>adjtimex</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core sdwdate code is good and should probably not change too much. What should probably change is the <code>sclockadj</code> tool that is used for doing small clock jumps, and we need a way to allow sdwdate to provide time values for other VMs to sync themselves to.</p>
<hr>
<p>The below is my research into using adjtimex, The tl;dr: is that <strong>we probably should not use adjtimex for initial clock synchronization after boot, but it may be usable to keep the clock in sync thereafter.</strong></p>
<p>Properly adjusting a clock using <code>adjtime</code> or <code>adjtimex</code> (slewing it to the correct value using in-kernel support) is very, very slow. According to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/188620/535873" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">time - How long will NTP take to adjust the clock if it doesn't immediately set it? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a> it takes approximately 4.17 minutes to adjust the clock by 128 milliseconds, or at least it did in 2015. In my testing with adjtimex, this is still approximately correct - it appears that adjtimex adjusts the clock by 500 microseconds per second. This means it takes a little over 33 minutes to adjust the clock by one second.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that Tor (and therefore sdwdate) only allow us to resolve time to within a second at best because that’s the resolution of the HTTP headers we get. On top of that, we get the time from three different servers at once when using sdwdate and then go with the median value of those three times, meaning that in practice we’re not going to be within a second of accuracy because of network lag and all sorts of other things NTP is designed to work around and Tor isn’t. On top of that, we also randomize the clock a bit for greater anonymity, meaning that we might change the clock several seconds on each invocation of sdwdate. When it takes over half an hour to move the clock by one second, making a multi-second change will take <em>hours</em>. Now if we assume that the system’s clock is fairly accurate, and we only ever have <em>one</em> time randomization offset per session (generated randomly each session but never changed until the next reboot, I guess), we can probably skew the clock by a second or two on each sdwdate invocation without too much trouble. But if the network is shaky (for instance, the user is using cellular internet in bad conditions), it’s likely sdwdate will be trying to make much larger changes.</p>
<p>(Note, anecdotally it seems that sdwdate doesn’t see any particular need to change the clock in my KVM virtual machine when I restart sdwdate, at least while my network is working well. The median time difference keeps being 0. That being said, other time differences were frequently reported that were not the median, so I assume that users won’t always get this lucky.)</p>
<p>The current <code>sclockadj</code> code adjusts the clock by 5 million nanoseconds per second. This is <em>ten times</em> faster than adjtimex, which adjusts by 5 hundred thousand nanoseconds per second. Thus sclockadj can handle multi-second adjustments without too much grief, but only by doing clock jumps. Switching to clock slewing with adjtimex will slow down our time adjustments very much.</p>
<p>The 500 microseconds per second adjustment rate is not configurable, it is unfortunately hardcoded in the kernel’s NTP code, which the <code>adjtimex</code> system call uses to do its work of slewing the clock. There isn’t any way to do a “fast slew” to my awareness, unless we want to try to contribute a feature for this to the kernel (which… might be possible?).</p>
<p>Based on the above, I think we might get away with using adjtimex to keep the clock in sync once it is initially synchronized. For making an adjustment of a second or two, it’s probably enough. But on first boot, when the clock is most likely to be several seconds slow or fast (especially on machines with no BIOS battery or a broken battery), we probably need to just use a clock jump. This is similar to the behavior of ntpd.</p>
<hr>
<p>For making sdwdate able to act as a server under Qubes OS, there are a couple of issues to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qubes OS currently synchronizes all VMs to dom0’s time, at least when resuming after suspend. But we would like for dom0 to be able to synchronize itself to sys-(ops-)whonix also.</li>
<li>Every VM on the system should ideally have slightly different time, and should get their time values from a different sdwdate time sync invocation (to avoid one bad sync affecting all VMs on the system).</li>
</ul>
<p>To work with the first issue, we can simply have all VMs (including sys-(ops-)whonix) blindly trust dom0’s time to begin with. Once a successful sdwdate sync is done however, the VM should record how its time differs from dom0’s time. Then, on resume-from-suspend, the VM can take the time given to it by dom0, and adjust it by the offset before syncing the clock. Any time dom0’s clock changed, it would have to announce this to all running VMs so they could recalculate their offsets from dom0.</p>
<p>To work around the second issue, we need some way for a virtual machine to get “whatever the current time is +/- some fixed offset” each time they synchronize their clock with the ClockVM. The fixed offset should be unique per-machine and per-boot, but should be constant between boots to avoid needing lots of clock jumps forward and backward. To acheive this, the client process that gets the time from the ClockVM should create a random identifier on launch, and present that identifier to sdwdate every time it syncs the clock. When sdwdate sees an identifier it hasn’t seen previously, it should generate a new random offset, but if it sees an identifier it’s seen previously, it should use the same offset it presented last time. This way each VM can have its time a little bit different, but that “little bit different” will be static for each virtual machine (until the client VM or ClockVM is rebooted, at least).</p>
<p>We don’t have to tack a bunch of code onto the existing sdwdate code base in order to make it able to act like a server. We should just create a new server process that serves whatever the ClockVM’s current time is (+/- the fixed offset described earlier) to clients. This probably won’t be very difficult to do at all. We will need this server process to NOT serve time until after sdwdate has synced the clock, but thankfully sdwdate already reports its status to other processes on the same VM, so we can rely on that.</p>

            <p>How to check if all files in Debian are installed with the correct permissions? For example, consider a case where a command was accidentally run, such as:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod -x /usr/libexec/package-name/script-name

<p>Tools like <code>dpkg --audit</code>, <code>debsums</code>, <code>dpkg --verify</code> do not detect this kind of issue.</p>
<p>Which tool can verify file permissions against the expected values from the package?</p>

            <p>We can also support App-per-VM rollback, or install older version directly, if these (old) packages already exists in the repository (in case we gonna use something similar to nix or arch).</p>
<p>This approach doesn’t conflict with the core philosophy of keep it updated, as the primary focus remains on using updated software, not rollbacks.</p>

            <p>Only x86 will should be supported, due to its widespread use (Intel or AMD CPUs or so). Support may be extended in the future to other freedom (or almost freedom) based architectures, such as RISC-V.</p>
<p>ARM or similar proprietary architectures will not be supported—there’s no reason to waste time on them. Supporting the most common proprietary architecture (x86) is sufficient. (Though seL4&amp;Linux supports ARM anyway).</p>

            <p>Rescue mode is like giving a backdoor to your own OS or software. If you break your system or forget your password, it’s your responsibility, no one else’s and no help will be provided, because there’s nothing anyone can do.</p>
<p>This also encourages users to maintain proper backups of their data, whether on their own hardware or in the cloud.</p>
<p>(Rollback and Snapshots helps as well)</p>
