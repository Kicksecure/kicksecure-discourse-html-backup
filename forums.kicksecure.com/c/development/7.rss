          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello. I have read an article from the anarsec guide about best practices using Tails. It recommends to use a write protect switch. It mentions two methods (using a USB drive with a write-protect switch and using a mircoSD card) that relies either on a proprietary hardware, or on a method that is not secure (SD card write protect switch asks for a protection but does not physically prevent writing on the disk).</p>
<p>But the article mention one way that could provide a provably secure operating system : Load the OS into RAM. The idea would be to boot the ISO on, load it into RAM, unplug the drive, and then start browsing the internet and maybe expose to viruses and malwares. <strong>My proposition is to add an option to load Kicksecure/Whonix Host into RAM with a graphical interface.</strong><br>
Sorry for my grammar, English is not my native language.</p>
<p><em>P.S. : I know that compromising the Kicksecure/Whonix source code would make this protection futile, but three-letters-agency-secret-supply-chain-attacks-operations aside this would allow a nearly invulnerable system against virus persistence.</em></p>

          <title>Support for hibernation?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>We need to decide what we’re doing with hibernation. Either we should determine how to set it up in a secure fashion and implement that, or we should remove hibernation-related documentation from the wiki and disable the hibernation button in LXQt.</p>
<p>Hardware support challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation may or may not work properly on Linux. Many users seem to have it working without issues, I have yet to get it working on a machine here. From what I’ve heard, SteamOS supports hibernation and has it working reliably, so maybe it’s robust enough to deploy in general now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation takes data that is intended to be ephemeral, and makes it persistent. Any secrets, unsaved work, live-booted virtual machines, etc., are all dumped to a swapfile or swap partition when the system is hibernated, making them much easier for an attacker to access if they can get access to the volume containing the swap file/partition.</li>
<li>This can be mitigated somewhat by using full disk encryption, however this is vulnerable to the possibility that the user will choose a weak encryption passphrase, and of course there’s always the <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench problem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>swap-file-creator would probably need to change in order to support hibernation. Right now we use an encrypted swapfile with an ephemeral encryption key, allowing swap to be used safely but also making it impossible to recover after a reboot. We may also need to do something with the way in which the swapfile is managed, since we need to have a single, static swapfile, we can’t be dynamically creating a new one on every boot or similar.</li>
<li>Hibernation is not reliable if you are trying to hibernate into an existing swapfile. If memory is filled and swap is partially filled, there won’t be enough space left in the swapfile to save the remaining contents of RAM into. SteamOS reportedly gets around this by using a dedicated hibernation file (which I guess means they probably somehow give the resume mechanism multiple swapfiles?).</li>
<li>Hibernation would need to be disabled when FDE was not in use, unless we want to implement something where the user is prompted for a one-time-use passphrase for securing the hibernation file, which is then prompted for upon resume. (Actually, that could be really neat, even with FDE, since it would mean an attacker would have to break both the FDE key and the hibernation key in order to get access to RAM contents. This would require the user to have a very good memory though.)</li>
<li>Related: <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/cryptsetup-suspend" class="inline-onebox">Debian -- Details of package cryptsetup-suspend in trixie</a> Unsure whether we’d want to use this with hibernation or not, or if it works with dracut.</li>

          <title>Power management for physical hardware in Kicksecure 18</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Right now, idle power management is planned to be disabled under virtual machines, both Qubes and non-Qubes, in Kicksecure 18. However, it’s unclear how we want to handle power management on physical hardware.</p>
<p>First off, a lot of the power management features of LXQt include the ability to suspend or hibernate the machine. Hibernation obviously has security risks because RAM contents are dumped to the disk, but hibernation likely doesn’t work out of the box on Kicksecure anyway, and LUKS can mitigate most of the concerns. What is more concerning is suspend, because LXQt unfortunately puts the system into suspend <em>before</em> locking the screen. This means if one wakes the system, they will be shown a flash of the user’s desktop before the screen locks. It’s extremely brief, but it’s more than long enough to capture a snapshot of the user’s screen with a camera (and depending on the speed of the system it might be enough to deploy a malware payload via a rubber ducky or similar before the screen locks).</p>
<p>LXQt has a lot of power management features; going through each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery watcher. Allows the user to lock their screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, turn off external monitors, and/or receive a notification when the system’s power gets too low. Can warn users for some period of time before taking a power management action in response to a low battery. Also shows a battery level icon.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very little concerns. An attacker who gets access to an encrypted but unlocked system might use the charge level to decide whether or not they want to keep the system powered on while moving it to a more convenient attack location, or if they want to attempt an attack right where they’re at, but in all likelihood hiding this info likely won’t defend against most realistic attack scenarios.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Same concerns as for battery level, this is probably even less worrisome.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Same concerns as battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Security impact identical to battery low notifications.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Minor positive security impact, though most users would be better served by automatically locking the screen after some duration of idle time.</li>
<li>Suspend: Minor negative security impact (could be problematic if the battery reaches a low power level before the screen locks due to idleness, due to screen locking prevention discussed above).</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Usually not a concern because it doesn’t work out of the box.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Minor positive security impact, though again this would be better handled by an idle timeout.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Very minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Battery level icon: Very useful for laptop users. Mobile users could run out of power mid-work without this.</li>
<li>Battery low notifications: Useful for the same reason as the battery level icon.</li>
<li>Warning (timeout before taking power management action): Positive usability impact. Mitigates issues introduced by automatic power management actions.</li>
<li>Low power actions:
<ul>
<li>Ask: Annoying because it suddenly creates a popup window like so: <div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png" data-download-href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd" title="Screenshot_20251031_162822"><img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png" alt="Screenshot_20251031_162822" data-base62-sha1="v6nqZuM6SBVxaI1P7Qsp42TiPk9" width="568" height="500" srcset="https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_568x500.png, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd_2_852x750.png 1.5x, https://forums.kicksecure.com/uploads/default/original/1X/d9fbf60da81a866fe3d4e66001491e061c3857cd.png 2x" data-dominant-color="9DA3C1"></a></div> Possibly dangerous, users could lose work if they tried to click inside a window right where the shutdown, reboot, or logout button appeared just as the window popped up. The power management warning is only a partial mitigation for this.</li>
<li>Lock screen: Rather useless for preserving battery life, mildly annoying even with the warning timer.</li>
<li>Suspend: Mildly annoying, but may prevent loss of work by preserving battery power. The warning timeout mitigates this. Overall, positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Same usability impact as suspend, except it takes longer to enter and exit hibernate. Overall, possibly positive usability impact.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Very annoying and dangerous, user will lose all unsaved work when the power level gets too low unless they are able to immediately plug in a source of power when the warning notification appears. Not sufficiently mitigated by the warning timeout, unless the timeout is made very long.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Possibly somewhat useful for avoiding data loss since powering off monitors may improve battery life, but this isn’t that useful. Mildly annoying. Attempts to use xset to power off monitors, thus it doesn’t even work under Wayland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid watcher. Controls what happens when the user closes the lid of the system. Can lock the screen, suspend, hibernate, shutdown, or turn off monitors when the lid is closed. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC power, and also support separate settings for when an external monitor isn’t attached and when it is.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>No difference in security concerns between the different customization possibilities (on battery / on AC / with external monitor connected / without external monitor connected) except in as much as each option applies to individual user threat models. For instance, a user might only plug their system in while at a location safe from physical attackers, thus their threat model would permit more convenient settings while plugged in and require more safe settings while unplugged.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render whatever they were actively working on inaccessible to a physically present attacker, barring a screen lock bypass or vulnerability in another component of their installation.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact. Closing the lid will indefinitely prevent the screen lock and allow a physically present attacker to capture a screenshot of their work as explained above.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. If user has unencrypted swap, this is virtually fatal when defending against a physically present attacker, as they can capture not only everything that was on the screen, but the full memory contents of everything on the system. If swap is encrypted and requires a passphrase to unlock, this probably won’t suffer from the indefinite screen lock pause issue because a password will be required to resume. If swap is encrypted but a TPM can unlock it, then this suffers from the same issues as suspend. (Note to readers: This is all theoretical, Kicksecure lacks features that would be needed to do things like unlocking an encrypted hibernation volume with a passphrase or TPM with a vanilla Kicksecure configuration.)</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact. User can close lid to render everything they were doing inaccessible to a physically present attacker, even if their system contains vulnerable components. However, shutdown may be slow, giving an attacker a window of opportunity to extract useful data before the system shuts down (most attackers probably will not be able to act fast enough for this to be of any use to them). Would be better if there was a way to trigger emerg-shutdown when the lid was closed.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Extremely minor positive security impact, maybe, but so negligible as to call it nonexistent unless dealing with an attacker in possession of technology that can reconstruct screen contents based on the light coming from the screen’s reflection off the laptop chassis. Even then, some laptops turn off their screen in hardware when the lid is closed. Might have more of a positive impact if external monitors can be turned off also.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>The different customization possibilities have different usability concerns based on the action in question.</li>
<li>Lid close actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Most users used to WIndows will expect that closing the lid will result in the screen being locked. (They would also expect the system to suspend, but at least this fulfills some of the expectation.)</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. On one hand, most users used to Windows will expect taht closing the lid will result in the system going into suspend. On the other hand, suspend may interrupt actions such as software updates, downloads, long running processes, etc., and thus be undesirable for some users.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact. User has to wait for RAM contents to be reloaded from swap upon resume, and may need to authenticate before the system fully resumes.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they or someone else (usually a pet) closes the lid unintentionally.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness Watcher: Controls what happens when the system has been idle for some duration of time. Has the same set of power management actions as the lid watcher. Supports separate settings for when on battery and when on AC, and allows configuring the time before the system is considered idle. Can disable idleness checks when a fullscreen app is in use. Also offers backlight change settings, but these will almost certainly not work for users with user-sysmaint-split installed.
<ul>
<li>Security concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive security impact. Users who forget to lock their screen before walking away from their machine will be protected from a physically present attacker, if that attacker doesn’t manage to see the screen contents of the user’s system before the lock screen activates.</li>
<li>Suspend: Negative security impact due to the locking issue described at the top of the post.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Security impact dependent upon setup. Identical concerns as for the hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Positive security impact for the same reasons as the lock screen idleness action. Protections against exploits are stronger.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive security impact. Attacker would need to be trying to physically observe user’s screen from some distance for this to matter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Same security impact as the “Turn Off monitor(s)” idleness action, but likely less effective than truly turning off the monitor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Usability concerns:
<ul>
<li>Idleness actions:
<ul>
<li>Lock screen: Positive usability impact. Users used to Windows will not expect their system to be accessible to an adversary who shows up and looks at the system after some amount of time has passed.</li>
<li>Suspend: Debatable usability impact. May improve battery life, but can also interrupt long-running processes, see usability concerns for suspend lid close action.</li>
<li>Hibernate: Debatable but probably negative usability impact, see usability concerns for hibernate lid close action.</li>
<li>Shutdown: Dangerous, negative usability impact. User will lose all unsaved work if they have to step away from the system for longer than the configured idle time.</li>
<li>Turn Off monitor(s): Minor positive usability impact due to power savings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Brightness controls: Positive usability impact due to power savings, but usually this won’t work as mentioned above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Power keys: Allows configuring what to do when the user presses a power, suspend, or hibernate key. These options do nothing under Wayland, power keys are configured by the compositor instead, thus skipping this section.</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally, I’d recommend the following settings for physical hardware installations based on the above analysis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Battery Watcher:
<ul>
<li>Low power action: Nothing</li>
<li>Warning timeout: 30 seconds</li>
<li>Level is low at: 10%</li>
<li>Show icon: Yes</li>
<li>Icon for the icon: Whatever the default is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lid Watcher:
<ul>
<li>When lid is closed on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>When lid is closed on AC power: Lock screen</li>
<li>Disable the extra settings for when using external monitors</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Idleness watcher:
<ul>
<li>When idle on AC: Lock screen</li>
<li>AC idle time: Unsure. For paranoid setups, a very short time might be preferable (30 seconds is the shortest supported timeout), but IMO people should not be relying on the idle timeout for security anyway because it is by nature unreliable. Thus we can probably favor usability here since security is better obtained by other means. Maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>When idle on battery: Lock screen</li>
<li>Battery idle time: Unsure, maybe just accept the default of 15 minutes?</li>
<li>Disable backlight change</li>
<li>Do not disable idleness checks when fullscreen</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

          <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[goose4]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p>

          <title>Request and Idea for including a tmpfs-setup package?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[0x506c61746f]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This idea was inspired by this users post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-regarding-use-of-tmpfs-formatting-and-conflicts/1057" class="inline-onebox">Questions regarding use of tmpfs formatting and conflicts</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Summery of idea in a nutshell is basically to make the package set /tmp mount point to tmpfs and add a <code>/etc/profile.d/</code> drop in to set the <code>XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache</code> variable for all users shell.</p>
<h2><a name="p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3384-idea-for-etcprofiledxdg-cachesh-1"></a>Idea for /etc/profile.d/xdg-cache.sh</h2>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#!/bin/sh

## Set XDG_CACHE_HOME to a per-user cache directory.
#   Prefer a private sub-directory under /tmp when /tmp is a tmpfs.
#   Fall back to ${HOME}/.cache if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
#
## Detect whether /tmp is a mount point (i.e. a separate filesystem).
#    On most modern distros this will be a tmpfs, but on some it may
#    be a regular disk partition.
if grep -q "^tmpfs.*/tmp.*tmpfs" /proc/mounts || mountpoint -q /tmp; then

    # /tmp is a mount point - assume it is a tmpfs.
    BASE_ROOT="/tmp/${USER}"
else
    # /tmp is part of the root filesystem (disk based).
    # Use the traditional default users /home based cache location instead.
    BASE_ROOT="${HOME}"
fi

## Build the final cache directory path.
#    We always put the cache in a ".cache" sub-folder so that tools
#    that follow the XDG spec find what they expect.
CACHE_DIR="${BASE_ROOT}/.cache"

## Ensure the directory exists and is private to the user.
#    /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), so we must create a
#    private subtree and lock it down with chmod 700.
#
# Create the parent directory (only needed when we are using /tmp)
if [ "${BASE_ROOT}" != "${HOME}" ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -d "${BASE_ROOT}" ]; then
    mkdir -p "${BASE_ROOT}"
    chmod 700 "${BASE_ROOT}"          
fi

# Now create the .cache directory itself
mkdir -p "${CACHE_DIR}"
chmod 700 "${CACHE_DIR}"

## Export the variable so the rest of the session sees it.
export XDG_CACHE_HOME="${CACHE_DIR}"
</code></pre>
<p>For the above To make it more bullet‑proof, you could tighten the /tmp detection for the <code>export XDG_CAHCE_HOME="/tmp/${USER}/.cache</code> creation</p>
<p>Systemd can generate a tmpfs mount for /tmp via the tmp.mount unit, but that unit is optional and can be disabled.<br>
In live environments, the initramfs (often via dracut in Kicksecure case) typically mounts tmpfs at /tmp automatically.<br>
Either the package should detect this and not interfere. otherwise a more robust way would be to ship <code>/etc/fstab</code> to be mounted to tmpfs by enabling and masking the builtin systemd unit, completely bypassing the need to fiddle with /etc/fstab. This is via enabling systemd’s tmp.mount unless it interferes with grub-live?</p>

</code></pre>
<p>Would this be a good idea to implement or do you think its a waste of time since grub-live “Live Mode” already exists and it could complicate its implementation or conflict with it with complexity?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Solaris has been doing this since 1994. (Much like other Unixes, too.) Debian’s next release defaults to tmpfs on /tmp, too. ArchLinux defaults to this as well. Ubuntu has plans for their 12.10 release.</p>

<p>From trixie, the default is for the /tmp/ directory to be stored in memory using a tmpfs(5) filesystem. This should make applications using temporary files faster, but if you put large files there, you may run out of memory.</p>

          <title>Chvt - change foreground virtual terminal (VT) (tty) - prevent malware from forced tty change</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[Patrick]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Issue:</p>
<p>Malware could switch to another tty but can’t attempt to log in there or feed any data. Malware could pull the user from an emergency session tty back to the original graphical session where the malware runs.</p>
<p>How to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>login into a tty3 - ideally as root</li>
<li><code>chvt 3 &amp;&amp; sleep 3 &amp;&amp; chvt 2</code></li>
</ol>
<p>This also works which is a bit scary. So chvt can even boss around root.</p>
<p>This forced terminal change is something I’d like to fix.</p>
<p>Non-solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Require sudo”: chvt does not require sudo/root.</li>
<li>“Set chvt noSUID”: chvt is already non-suid.</li>
<li>“Delete chvt”: chvt is a user-space utility. Malware could ship the same tool or malware could run the same syscall. Deleting chvt therefore does not accomplish very much.</li>
<li><code>/etc/security/access.con</code> Is only PAM configuration file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Real solution:</p>
<p>The only solution is a proper system configuration.</p>

<p>Would it be desirable to turn off this wired autoconnect feature by default? Users could still use wired networks, they would just have to explicitly connect to them using the network management widget.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One problem is that when you dual or multiboot, even if you are using encryption on your Qubes installation, /boot is still unprotected and could be maliciously modified by the other OS, possibly leading to Qubes itself being maliciously modified.</p>
<p>The other problem is firmware security - for example the other system could infect the BIOS firmware, which might enable compromise or spying on the Qubes system.</p>

          <title>USBGuard - what should we allow or disallow by default?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Kicksecure 18 is intended to ship USBGuard by default, with a configuration that should block likely-malicious, unknown, and unusual devices. The hope is that it won’t block so much as to significantly increase the difficulty of using Kicksecure, while also making it more difficult to use devices such as the Hak5 rubber ducky or O.MG plug (popular keystroke injection devices).</p>
<p>Our current USBGuard configuration is visible at <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/blob/master/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">security-misc/etc/usbguard/rules.d/30_security-misc.conf at master · Kicksecure/security-misc · GitHub</a>. The original intent was to allow everything connected at boot, and then disallow everything other than mass storage devices, keyboards, and mice, while also not allowing keyboards or mice to be combined with other interfaces, and not allowing additional keyboards and mice to be attached if one is already present. However, as pointed out by Marek (the lead Qubes OS developer), this is going to cause <em>tons</em> of legitimate devices to be blocked: <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/commit/cba16879eff9d3d998c127e41c38d2067cdf04cc#r164474977" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Polish USBGuard configuration · Kicksecure/security-misc@cba1687 · GitHub</a></p>
<p>We have a pretty classic security vs. usability tradeoff here. We don’t want to block so much that users disable USBGuard because they can’t live with it, but we also don’t want to allow so much that malicious devices work in common configurations. It’s already risky enough allowing keyboards and mice to be attached after bootup, since if the only keyboard and mouse present on bootup is non-USB (as is the case with most laptops if you don’t plug additional devices into them), keystroke injection devices that present themselves as only a keyboard will be able to attack the system and succeed. But blocking <em>everything</em> other than keyboards, mice, and storage devices may be overkill also.</p>
<p>Does anyone have input on what should be blocked or not blocked by default? Some USB devices to think about here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Webcams
<ul>
<li>On its own, a webcam probably can’t cause too much trouble… the worst it could do is video the user on the user’s own machine, it would probably be much more useful for an attacker to record the user with an <em>attacker-controlled</em> machine, which of course USBGuard can’t do anything about.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Microphones
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Headsets/speakers/miscellaneous other USB audio devices
<ul>
<li>Similar situation as webcams.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Printers
<ul>
<li>Could introduce attack surface that we don’t want, see <a href="https://www.evilsocket.net/2024/09/26/Attacking-UNIX-systems-via-CUPS-Part-I/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Attacking UNIX Systems via CUPS, Part I</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MIDI interfaces
<ul>
<li>Probably pretty rare, no idea what the risks are of allowing these to be used by default, would probably block them just in case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Touchscreens
<ul>
<li>Input device, similar to a mouse, might even be handled already by allowing mice in the system. Dangers are similar or identical to allowing mice.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Android devices
<ul>
<li>Uses or at least used to use Media Transfer Protocol. Unsure what the risks are here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>USB Ethernet
<ul>
<li>Oftentimes uses RNDIS, which the Linux kernel maintainer Greg Kroah-Hartman has tried to get disabled in Linux at least <em>three times</em> due to supposedly unfixable security issues. (<a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disabling-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-Disable-RNDIS-Drivers</a>, <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-RNDIS-Removal-EOY2024</a>) I would consider this very high-risk and would NOT enable it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bluetooth dongles
<ul>
<li>Could be used to attach arbitrary devices to systems remotely, but this would require some user interaction. Unsure what the implications of a malicious Bluetooth dongle would be. Internal Bluetooth cards actually use the USB bus, but they’ll be present on boot and thus allowed, if everything works as expected.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2FA keys
<ul>
<li>I believe these present themselves as a human interface device, not sure how safe or unsafe this is or if it’s feasible to allow it by default.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Anything else we should consider allowing or not allowing by default?</li>

          <title>Sdwdate design enhancements</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Development</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Not sure there’s much to discuss here, this is just me doing a brain-dump of my research so that it’s not lost and so that others can comment on it as desirable.</p>
<p>The current iteration of sdwdate does a pretty good job of keeping the system’s clock accurate but skewed just enough to provide better anonymity under Whonix. However, it has a few shortcomings we’d like to resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only sets the time for the (virtual) machine it runs on, it isn’t able to act as a server for helping other virtual machines running on the same system to also synchronize their time securely. This is something that would be nice to fix in Qubes OS, allowing sys-whonix (or more likely, sys-ops-whonix once that exists) to act as a master time-keeper for all VMs.</li>
<li>The current way it adjusts the clock is somewhat awful - it does a large clock jump or two to get the time close enough to accurate to allow connecting to Tor, then does a large number of small clock jumps to get the time to a final “good” value. Clock jump confuse software in multiple ways, and the small clock jumps we do currently can result in systemd journal being flooded, so they’re best avoided, and if they’re needed, it’s best to do one clock jump and then slew the clock to the correct time using something like <code>adjtimex</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core sdwdate code is good and should probably not change too much. What should probably change is the <code>sclockadj</code> tool that is used for doing small clock jumps, and we need a way to allow sdwdate to provide time values for other VMs to sync themselves to.</p>
<hr>
<p>The below is my research into using adjtimex, The tl;dr: is that <strong>we probably should not use adjtimex for initial clock synchronization after boot, but it may be usable to keep the clock in sync thereafter.</strong></p>
<p>Properly adjusting a clock using <code>adjtime</code> or <code>adjtimex</code> (slewing it to the correct value using in-kernel support) is very, very slow. According to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/188620/535873" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">time - How long will NTP take to adjust the clock if it doesn't immediately set it? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a> it takes approximately 4.17 minutes to adjust the clock by 128 milliseconds, or at least it did in 2015. In my testing with adjtimex, this is still approximately correct - it appears that adjtimex adjusts the clock by 500 microseconds per second. This means it takes a little over 33 minutes to adjust the clock by one second.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that Tor (and therefore sdwdate) only allow us to resolve time to within a second at best because that’s the resolution of the HTTP headers we get. On top of that, we get the time from three different servers at once when using sdwdate and then go with the median value of those three times, meaning that in practice we’re not going to be within a second of accuracy because of network lag and all sorts of other things NTP is designed to work around and Tor isn’t. On top of that, we also randomize the clock a bit for greater anonymity, meaning that we might change the clock several seconds on each invocation of sdwdate. When it takes over half an hour to move the clock by one second, making a multi-second change will take <em>hours</em>. Now if we assume that the system’s clock is fairly accurate, and we only ever have <em>one</em> time randomization offset per session (generated randomly each session but never changed until the next reboot, I guess), we can probably skew the clock by a second or two on each sdwdate invocation without too much trouble. But if the network is shaky (for instance, the user is using cellular internet in bad conditions), it’s likely sdwdate will be trying to make much larger changes.</p>
<p>(Note, anecdotally it seems that sdwdate doesn’t see any particular need to change the clock in my KVM virtual machine when I restart sdwdate, at least while my network is working well. The median time difference keeps being 0. That being said, other time differences were frequently reported that were not the median, so I assume that users won’t always get this lucky.)</p>
<p>The current <code>sclockadj</code> code adjusts the clock by 5 million nanoseconds per second. This is <em>ten times</em> faster than adjtimex, which adjusts by 5 hundred thousand nanoseconds per second. Thus sclockadj can handle multi-second adjustments without too much grief, but only by doing clock jumps. Switching to clock slewing with adjtimex will slow down our time adjustments very much.</p>
<p>The 500 microseconds per second adjustment rate is not configurable, it is unfortunately hardcoded in the kernel’s NTP code, which the <code>adjtimex</code> system call uses to do its work of slewing the clock. There isn’t any way to do a “fast slew” to my awareness, unless we want to try to contribute a feature for this to the kernel (which… might be possible?).</p>
<p>Based on the above, I think we might get away with using adjtimex to keep the clock in sync once it is initially synchronized. For making an adjustment of a second or two, it’s probably enough. But on first boot, when the clock is most likely to be several seconds slow or fast (especially on machines with no BIOS battery or a broken battery), we probably need to just use a clock jump. This is similar to the behavior of ntpd.</p>
<hr>
<p>For making sdwdate able to act as a server under Qubes OS, there are a couple of issues to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qubes OS currently synchronizes all VMs to dom0’s time, at least when resuming after suspend. But we would like for dom0 to be able to synchronize itself to sys-(ops-)whonix also.</li>
<li>Every VM on the system should ideally have slightly different time, and should get their time values from a different sdwdate time sync invocation (to avoid one bad sync affecting all VMs on the system).</li>
</ul>
<p>To work with the first issue, we can simply have all VMs (including sys-(ops-)whonix) blindly trust dom0’s time to begin with. Once a successful sdwdate sync is done however, the VM should record how its time differs from dom0’s time. Then, on resume-from-suspend, the VM can take the time given to it by dom0, and adjust it by the offset before syncing the clock. Any time dom0’s clock changed, it would have to announce this to all running VMs so they could recalculate their offsets from dom0.</p>
<p>To work around the second issue, we need some way for a virtual machine to get “whatever the current time is +/- some fixed offset” each time they synchronize their clock with the ClockVM. The fixed offset should be unique per-machine and per-boot, but should be constant between boots to avoid needing lots of clock jumps forward and backward. To acheive this, the client process that gets the time from the ClockVM should create a random identifier on launch, and present that identifier to sdwdate every time it syncs the clock. When sdwdate sees an identifier it hasn’t seen previously, it should generate a new random offset, but if it sees an identifier it’s seen previously, it should use the same offset it presented last time. This way each VM can have its time a little bit different, but that “little bit different” will be static for each virtual machine (until the client VM or ClockVM is rebooted, at least).</p>
<p>We don’t have to tack a bunch of code onto the existing sdwdate code base in order to make it able to act like a server. We should just create a new server process that serves whatever the ClockVM’s current time is (+/- the fixed offset described earlier) to clients. This probably won’t be very difficult to do at all. We will need this server process to NOT serve time until after sdwdate has synced the clock, but thankfully sdwdate already reports its status to other processes on the same VM, so we can rely on that.</p>

            <p>Encryption keys are stored in hardware (like a TPM or otherwise), meaning even if the disk is removed, it cannot be decrypted without the original device.</p>

            <p>How to check if all files in Debian are installed with the correct permissions? For example, consider a case where a command was accidentally run, such as:</p>
<pre><code>sudo chmod -x /usr/libexec/package-name/script-name
</code></pre>
<p>Tools like <code>dpkg --audit</code>, <code>debsums</code>, <code>dpkg --verify</code> do not detect this kind of issue.</p>
<p>Which tool can verify file permissions against the expected values from the package?</p>

            <p>This feature will be the responsibility of the hypervisor provider like seL4 team or KVM or Xen…etc, whether they implement it correctly and securely or not. It’s particularly relevant in scenarios involving running an OS + VM inside another VM, or using a virtualizer/hypervisor within a VM (e.g. VirtualBox-in-VM).</p>
