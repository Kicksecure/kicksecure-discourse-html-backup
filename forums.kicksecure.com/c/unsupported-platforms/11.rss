            <p>I’m currently exploring the edges of the Linux universe. Now my focus is exploring the alt-init Linux systems.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if Kicksecure could/would run on a system like Devuan. I know you strictly support only vanilla Debian, but I like to experiment.</p>
<p>I wanted to know if Kicksecure is <code>systemd</code>-agnostic?</p>
<p>If you want to know my personal opinion about <code>systemd</code>, then I don’t care either way. I just like to tinker.</p>
