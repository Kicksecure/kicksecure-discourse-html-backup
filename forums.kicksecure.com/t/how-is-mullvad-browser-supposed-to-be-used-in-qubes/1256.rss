    <title>How is Mullvad Browser supposed to be used in Qubes</title>

    <description>There is no .desktop file provided and putting /usr/bin/mulvadbrowser into a .desktop file also does not seem to work properly.

Only usable way is launching it in a terminal first then basing a dispvm on top of that appvm to use the generated .desktop file. But updating like that is a pain.</description>

            <p>How are you installing Mullvad Browser? If you install it into a template using Mullvad’s deb repository, it should create a desktop file like most other applications and will be updated along with normal template updates. If you install Mullvad Browser using the <code>browser-choice</code> utility in Kicksecure, it will install the deb repository for you, so that’s probably the easiest way to do it. You can launch it from a template by running <code>browser-choice</code> in a terminal.</p>
<p>(Note that there is a wiki page for browser-choice at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Browser-choice" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Browser Choice - Browser Selection Installer Dialog</a>, but it is very incomplete. Most of the info about it is in the development planning page at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/browser-choice#criteria_for_inclusion_into_browser_choice" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Browser Choice</a> which focuses more on how browser-choice works internally.)</p>
