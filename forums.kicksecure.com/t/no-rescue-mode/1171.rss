    <description>Rescue mode is like giving a backdoor to your own OS or software. If you break your system or forget your password, it’s your responsibility, no one else&#39;s and no help will be provided, because there’s nothing anyone can do.

This also encourages users to maintain proper backups of their data, whether on their own hardware or in the cloud.

(Rollback and Snapshots helps as well)</description>
