    <title>Question about grub-live and writable file system</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/question-about-grub-live-and-writable-file-system/1221</link>
    <description>When I mount a Veracrypt container inside a grub-live session. The I get the red warning that there is a writable file system mounted. 

Is there a chance that traces are left on my disk now? How does this work? The whole veracrypt container is written to disk? The files are? Are there no traces. Please clarify</description>

            <p>The current live mode detection code isn’t Veracrypt-volume aware, so it can’t tell the difference between a container located on an ephemeral live filesystem, and a container located on a writable disk device. It just sees that you have a writable mounted device and warns you about it.</p>
<p>It might be possible to add code that is aware of Veracrypt volumes, but that would only make it work with Veracrypt specifically. There are a lot of applications that may mount a writable container that our code would have to be aware of, so in general this isn’t an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>If the container itself is located on an ephemeral filesystem, then your writes to it should disappear on reboot, just like with any file on the ephemeral filesystem.</p>
