    <title>My android phone not showing (USB connection)</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/my-android-phone-not-showing-usb-connection/1341</link>
    <description>Hi,

I’m new to kicksecure, and I have questions to get it fit my everyday needs.

I can’t connect my android phone to the computer. Once plugged via USB wire, nothing happens, and nothing in Thunar nor in Gnome Disks.

Once plugged, my phone reacts :

* it charges
* and asks me to choose a transfer mode

Is there some packet missing on my install ? Or a config I didn’t do ?

Looking on the forum and on the internet didn’t give any help.

Thanks for your help</description>

            <p>I successed in interfacing the phone to the OS, and thunar is now showing the phone automatically.</p>
<p>Many sites were wrong with the packages.</p>
<p>I finally found the good combination, combining various sites infos :</p>
<ol>
<li><code>sudo apt install gvfs-backends gfvs-fuse</code></li>
<li>disconnect from the kicksecure session, then reconnect to it so that changes are taken in account</li>
<li>plug the phone</li>
<li>on the phone select “file transfer”</li>
<li>it’s done (for me) : the phone appears in thunar and is now browsable</li>
</ol>

            <p>hi,</p>
<p>thanks for reply,</p>
<p>Yes I choosed a transfer mode (the same as on other OS, “file transfer”).</p>
<p>I tried to install mtpfs and gvfs-mtp as stated on the following site but apt tells me there are no such packages… : <a href="https://linuxvox.com/blog/mount-android-device-linux/#using-mtp-media-transfer-protocol" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Mount Android Device on Linux: A Comprehensive Guide — linuxvox.com</a></p>
<p>(I prefer not using the other solution, with ADB).</p>

            <p>Did you choose a transfer mode when prompted? I think you need to choose “MTP” (or similar) in order to get the device to show up. (There might be packages for MTP support that are missing from Kicksecure by default, you might have to search for and install those from the Debian archives.)</p>
