    <title>Installing FDE LUKS with Detached LUKS header option</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/installing-fde-luks-with-detached-luks-header-option/907</link>
    <description>You know there are great things that have been discussed/mentioned in the other thread called &quot;BusKill&quot; which shreds the LUKS header. Which leads to the data being useless due to it being no different then random data forensically.

Instead of that it would be better if Kicksecure developed the feature and option when selecting Full Disk Encryption via LUKS at installation. **To have the option to detach the LUKS header** and store it on another device whether that be a USB, SD Card, Smart Card, Yubikey, Nitrokey, etc.

The main development would be the integration into Grub as it would have to ask for device or detect a saved device that has the luks header aswell as ask for the passphrase. The other integration would be into the graphical installer (e.g. Calamares) for selecting such a option.

Currently there is no option to set up a Linux install with FDE and a detached header. However this implementation would greatly servers and personal computers alike.

Here is a good read about this topic.

**In summery here are the Benefits:**

- **Enhanced Security**: -- By separating the header from the encrypted data, users can reduce the risk of unauthorized access to their encrypted storage.

- **Flexibility**: -- Users can choose to store the header in a more secure location, such as a different device or a secure cloud storage solution.

- **Improved Usability**: -- This feature would cater to advanced users who require additional security measures for their sensitive data.

- **Plausible Denial**: -- By using a detached header, users can claim that the encrypted storage contains random data, as the absence of the header makes it impossible to decrypt the contents without the correct key. This provides a layer of plausible deniability, as users can assert that they do not possess the means to access the data.</description>

<p>This is because we use Debian’s GRUB, and Debian’s GRUB only has very bad LUKS support (only supports LUKS1, can’t handle non-US keyboard layouts, ugly, slow, only gives you one shot to unlock the drive, and then the Linux kernel has to unlock the drive <em>again</em> once it boots). Instead, we use an unencrypted /boot partition and let the initramfs handle decrypt. This lets us use more secure encryption, provides a better user interface for decryption, works with multiple keyboard layouts, and works faster.</p>

</aside>
<p>Isn’t LUKS2 supported now and standard? Now I’m even more confused tbh…Would GRUB implementation for detached header option be something that would be implemented by the graphical installer code that debian uses?</p>

<p>Ok no worries very understandable I get that. This is just something that has been on my mind for awhile now and thought I would share here since BusKill was mentioned.</p>

<p>The issue I do see with those two is that you can only order them online and for some threat models that may not be feasible or worth the risk to take.</p>

<p>Yeah but how is detached header any different then shredding the LUKS header? The only difference I see is there is no need to shred the LUKS header as long as you fully shutdown your computer.</p>
<p>Although in a emergency situation shredding the LUKS header would work better since you would have no way to ditch device that had the header on it in time. Unless it was a SD Card you could eat it lol.</p>
<p>The detached header with LUKS seems like a good way to secure a machine that is stored away.</p>
