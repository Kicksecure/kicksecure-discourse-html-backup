    <description>Hi guys, using the new updated kicksecure, but since the user and sysmaint account is seperated, I don&#39;t know how to access files between the accounts. For instance, I have an openvpn script in user but I can&#39;t run it if I have to reboot after using sudo. I also may have other times where I need ro run sudo on user files specificly and directories are not linked afaik. Can anyone support me here? Thanks.</description>
