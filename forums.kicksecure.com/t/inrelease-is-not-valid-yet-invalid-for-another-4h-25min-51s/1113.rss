    <description>In order to make a persistent kicksecure USB, it required a separate 

clean device, and it required an airgap also. 

There is an error message which gets displayed when running the installer script:

E: Release file for tor+https://fasttrack.debian.net/debian-fasttrack/dists/bookworm-

fasttrack/InRelease is not valid yet (invalid for another 4h 25min 51s). Updates for

this repository will not be applied. Not sure if this is due to updates 

to the code repo, but it returned the same error message 4h ago also.</description>

            <p>Fix clock on the host operating system by manually setting it.</p>
<p>Then set the hardware clock based on the software clock.</p>
<pre><code>sudo hwclock --systohc
</code></pre>
<p>That should help having a correct time after reboot.</p>
<p>If that does not work, it could be unspecific to Kicksecure and be hardware issue. Often a broken BIOS battery.</p>

<p>Hello. My friend and I bought new laptops. The date and time reset every day, and we have to fix it by changing the time in sysmaint mode, rebooting the system, and then everything works. However, after turning off the laptops, the problem returns, and we cannot receive updates or see the correct time on the taskbar. The laptops are from different brands</p>

            <p>Oh wait sorry I read that wrong…<br>
I like to bet on or however say to check your system time cause I have this issue before and it was related to my system time being off causing the repository’s InRelease file to appear invalid.<br>
NTP is disabled on Kicksecure/Whonix, so I would first check that Tor is working and especially restart <code>sdwdate</code></p><aside class="onebox allowlistedgeneric" data-onebox-src="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/Sdwdate">

<p>If that is not the case check that your BIOS clock is holding time between restarts, your CMOS battery might be dead or missing.<br>
In that case replace the CMOS battery or you will have to set the time to UTC manually before booting every time likely.</p>
<p>Two instances I know of this personally was 1 on my Pi that has NTP disabled and I had a power surge and it reset the date. The second was CMOS battery dead on laptop that didn’t have a battery requiring it to plugged in to use. meaning that once the main power was lost all BIOS setting were set to manufacturer reset so it was displaying the time and date as it being the year it was made.</p>
