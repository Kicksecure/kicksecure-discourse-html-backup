    <description>I studied all popular secure messengers and found that only Simplex provides not only high anonymity but also high protection (encrypted local storage and  self-destruct passcode). This is great for Kicksecure. I think you can copy this page to the Kicksecure wiki https://www.whonix.org/wiki/SimpleX and add Simplex and Session https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Session to section of recommended messengers https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Software#Instant_Messengers

Or I can add links to the websites of these messengers in the wiki:
[https://simplex.chat/ SimpleX]
[https://getsession.org/ Session]
and maybe:
[https://docs.cwtch.im/ Cwtch]
## XMPP/Jabber Client

            <p>Wow, it is very interesting. I read his recent articles from 2024-2025, and he also does not recommend XMPP due to weak cryptography and outdated versions of OMEMO <a href="https://soatok.blog/2024/08/04/against-xmppomemo/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Against XMPP+OMEMO - Dhole Moments</a> He writes that Cwtch has not undergone any security audits. He recommends only Signal and Simplex Chat, but he acknowledges the issue of the phone number in Signal. It seems that Simplex is currently the only messenger that does not have account registration issues, encryption problems, works with Tor and the clearnet, and has powerful security features.</p>

            <p>Session was given an informal security audit and did <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/14/dont-use-session-signal-fork/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">very, very poorly</a>. The same cryptographer that did this initial investigation then wrote <a href="https://soatok.blog/2025/01/20/session-round-2/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">a followup</a> pointing out some more problems. This same cryptographer also discovered CVEs in Matrix’s encryption, so I think they likely know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>I’ve done quite a bit of research into SimpleX (I actually wrote some of the content that’s now in the page you linked to), and its cryptography has been security-audited with relatively positive results, so I’m pretty hopeful for it.</p>
