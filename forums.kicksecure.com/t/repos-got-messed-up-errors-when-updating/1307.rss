    <description>I did not update Kicksecure in a long time because I was in 

[details=&quot;Summary&quot;]
rehab for a very serious addiction to mushrooms, alcohol, and heroin

[/details]

a long vacation. When I got back, nothing worked at all for sudo apt-update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-upgrade with multiple time out errors and unable to connect to repo errors.

I sometimes use Kicksecure in a virt-manager connected to whonix gateway. I am not sure if this is the problem. (Yes, it is connected to 10.152.152.X and I can browse)

I made the mistake of going into etc/apt and just randomly deleting and modifying things, figuring the bookworm stuff was the problem. Now it seems like a mess and I don’t know what to do.

I know I can choose stable/beta from the Repository application and tried to do that already.

Does anyone have a list of what should be in /etc/apt?</description>

            <p>Is this because it’s trying to update via tor and then trying to create tor over tor connections?</p>
<p>When I get the error I see this message:</p>
