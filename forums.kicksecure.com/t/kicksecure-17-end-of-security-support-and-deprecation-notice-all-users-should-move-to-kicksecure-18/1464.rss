    <description>As per Kicksecure [Support Schedule](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/About#Support_Schedule), this post serves as the Kicksecure version 17 deprecation notice.

Kicksecure 18 stable has been released for all platforms.

**Kicksecure 17 will be deprecated on `06 February 2026`.**

    All users should upgrade!

The more time that passes after the deprecation date, the harder or even impossible it might become to perform an in-place [release upgrade](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Release_Upgrade).

* [Non-Qubes-Kicksecure](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Non-Qubes-Kicksecure): No special notice.
* [Qubes-Kicksecure](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Qubes): Quote [Support Schedule](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/About#Support_Schedule)

&gt; * Version [`17`: The goal is to provide support for as long as Qubes `R4.2` receives security support from Qubes](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/10219) and Debian. [footnote in wiki]</description>
