    <title>Zsh color theme</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/zsh-color-theme/803</link>
    <description>Hi. help me how to change zsh theme? I have .zsh file which I used in previous linux distribution. if this file replaces default .zsh in /home/user/ then only header changes. default zsh is empty (like on github). I am not advanced user and I can not find file which is responsible for commands color scheme. I found that color scheme is connected with desktop-config-dist package, but I do not understand what file is responsible for zsh colors. if I delete desktop-config-dist then other packages are also deleted - I would not like to do that. I will be grateful for help</description>

            <p>All files are in folder /etc/zsh only.</p>
<p>File /etc/zsh/zshrc_prompt has colors.</p>

<p>Use<br>
<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Debian_Packages#dummy-dependency">dummy-dependency</a><br>
in such cases. But only after checking first what else that package is<br>
doing.</p>
