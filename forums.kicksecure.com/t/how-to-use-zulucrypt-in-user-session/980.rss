    <title>How to use zulucrypt in USER Session?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/how-to-use-zulucrypt-in-user-session/980</link>
    <description>Hello. How to use zulucrypt in USER mode / USER live mode? I received an important encrypted secret steganographic container in messenger, but I could not open it due to sudo restrictions. I need to reboot, decrypt file, and then load again in USER mode / live mode to respond to interlocutor. This will be inconvenient (this can be a confidential important conversation where time is crucial - for example, if it is related to investigative journalism). What would you recommend in this case? Installing zulucrypt in Podman or Distrobox?

ps Live mode SYSMAINT is very good for viewing encrypted containers and do not save secret session to disk, when you are not limited by time</description>

<p>Yes. And this mode is perfect for testing new unknown packages and new repositories. Even in an encrypted container, zulucrypt can have a virus that will be destroyed by reboot. Virus would have to perform more actions in live mode. If you close ports in iptables or gufw, or extract encrypted file without connecting to internet, system will receive minimal damage or avoid it.</p>
<p>But in User mode, I think its best to use container or a very small VM (ideally, one could dream of a minimalist sysmaint-VM image…)</p>

            <p>Thank you. I think you can add a variant with podman/distrobox to wiki. One user wrote on forum that to run a vm in live mode, more than 12 g of memory is required, but to run Whonix, more than 20 g will be needed. Live mode is ideal for confidential conversations and secret operations, but not every computer can run vm in live mode. Giving user-session elevated sudo privileges is too risky. I think user session and live user session are very similar to Fedora Secureblue, where it is necessary to work with containers, and podman is the simplest option. It seems zulucrypt works well in podman</p>
