    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m using Kicksecure as my OS, not live.

I&#39;m trying to add an alias, so when I modify the ~/.bashrc and then source it I get the following response : 


```

It then launches another shell with a weird prompt (last string at the end) where the alias does work, but when I quit and open another terminal the prompt is back to normal and the alias doesn&#39;t work. When I check the .bashrc file the modification are still there.</description>

            <p>I am very dumb, I changed the ~/.zshrc instead and it had the intended effect.<br>
I was not clear that I wanted the default shell to have the alias, I just assumed it was bash by default.<br>
I’m still confused about what happens when I source the ~/.bashrc tho</p>
