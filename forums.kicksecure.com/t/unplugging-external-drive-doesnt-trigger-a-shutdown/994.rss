    <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unplugging-external-drive-doesnt-trigger-a-shutdown/994</link>
    <description>Hello Kicksecure folks,

I installed Debian on my brand new Western Digital external SSD drive. Then I proceeded to distro morph it following the guide (prob should have went with the ISO route) and everything works as intended.

However when I unplug my SSD or it comes unplugged somehow (has happened before) it doesn&#39;t trigger a full shutdown?

Why doesn&#39;t it fully shutdown when unplugged?
I do want to add that also set up LUKS when I installed Debian.

Do I need to create a udev rule that runs a shutdown script (unmount, cryptsetup luksClose, and sync)?</description>
