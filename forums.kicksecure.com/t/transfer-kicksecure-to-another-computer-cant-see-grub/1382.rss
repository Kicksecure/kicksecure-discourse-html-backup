    <title>Transfer kicksecure to another computer. can&#39;t see grub</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/transfer-kicksecure-to-another-computer-cant-see-grub/1382</link>
    <description>I installed kicksecure on a portable SSD along with linux mint, grub kicksecure boots by default and sees mint.
Moved the SSD to a second computer and it does not see grub kicksecure, but sees grub mint. Why is this happening? Is there an easy way to fix this?
sudo os-prober in mint does not find kicksecure.

Do I have to boot into a live iso system, mount the kicksecure partition there and in chroot mode do this command?
efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sdX -p Y -L ‘Kicksecure’ -l ‘EFI\\Kicksecure\\shimx64.efi’

Is there no other way?</description>

            <p>IIRC, Kicksecure 17 had a problem where the fallback bootloader would only provide a GRUB prompt, but not actually boot the system. The real bootloader would boot the system, but that isn’t easily feasible to use in a portable system unless your system’s UEFI firmware has a good bootloader autodetection mechanism or offers a “Boot from File” option.</p>
<p>This seems to be fixed in Kicksecure 18. If you feel like trying a testing release, you might give that a shot and see if it works for you?</p>
