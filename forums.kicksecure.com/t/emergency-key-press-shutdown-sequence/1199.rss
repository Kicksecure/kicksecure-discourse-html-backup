    <title>Emergency key press shutdown sequence</title>

    <description>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unplugging-external-drive-doesnt-trigger-a-shutdown/994 -&gt; this will be implemented soon: Removal of boot device will result in emergency shutdown. This will become available in Kicksecure 18 most likely.

As an additional feature, at the same time, we can provide an emergency key combination. Once pressed, a force shutdown sequence can be triggered.

We&#39;re wondering about which key combination to use for that?

**Ctrl+Alt+Del** (sometimes called the &quot;[three-finger salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete)&quot;): May not be the most suitable. Different plans for this: https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/ctrl-alt-del-three-finger-salute-action/1197

Potential choices:

* **Ctrl+Shift+Esc**
* **Ctrl+Alt+Esc** 
* **Ctrl+Alt+Backspace**</description>

            <p>Ctrl+*+Esc combos slightly scare me since Ctrl+Esc is the shortcut for bringing up the task manager under KDE, and I believe Ctrl+Shift+Esc does so on Windows.</p>
<p>Another possible shortcut is Ctrl+Alt+End, which is used by Windows Remote Desktop to send a Ctrl+Alt+Delete keypress to a remote PC. Using the End key would be rather fitting for this also, since an emergency shutdown will immediately end whatever you were doing on the computer.</p>
