    <title>Emergency key press shutdown sequence</title>

    <description>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unplugging-external-drive-doesnt-trigger-a-shutdown/994 -&gt; this will be implemented soon: Removal of boot device will result in emergency shutdown. This will become available in Kicksecure 18 most likely.

As an additional feature, at the same time, we can provide an emergency key combination. Once pressed, a force shutdown sequence can be triggered.

We&#39;re wondering about which key combination to use for that?

**Ctrl+Alt+Del** (sometimes called the &quot;[three-finger salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete)&quot;): May not be the most suitable. Different plans for this: https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/ctrl-alt-del-three-finger-salute-action/1197

Potential choices:

* **Ctrl+Shift+Esc**
* **Ctrl+Alt+Esc** 
* **Ctrl+Alt+Backspace**</description>
