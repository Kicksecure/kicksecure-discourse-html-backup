    <title>Installing Kicksecure breaks NFS</title>

    <description>on a debian 12 install, I configured NFS for use on my local LAN. I did intsall network-manager-gnome and openvpn..

after my client was able to mount the remote (local LAN). after installing kicksecure, I cannot get them to connect.

connection timeout when trying to mount from the command line.

I have double shecked hosts.allow and exports on the server, but they didnt seem to have been altered by installing kicksecure.

I DO have multiple NIC installed (4). 2 in use to WAN via router1, and 1 in use to router2 (local LAN)

portlist shows tcp 2049
rpcinfo shows
portmapper ports 111 TCP &amp; UDP for versions 2,3,4
nfs ports 2049 TCP versions 3 &amp; 4, and a nfs_acl on 2049 for version 3

ideally i would prefer to have an IP or MAC verified w/o kerberos, but I will take what I can at the moment I cant get mount working...</description>

            <p>[lots of angry comments go here]</p>
<p>but let me say thank you.</p>
<p>commenting the line ‘install nfsv4 /usr/bin/disabled-netfilesys-by-security-misc’ in /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc instantly fixed this issue for me.</p>
<p>many very frustrating hours were spent trying to remedy this problem before I created an account and posting.</p>
<p>I now see lots of security holes in nfs I must plug but its working. As my skills increse, at some point I will learn how to to setup a DNS server and kerberos on my server in the never ending pusuit of security.</p>

            <p>Not sure this will help…</p>
<p>Try commenting out the following lines from <code>/etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc.conf</code>.</p>
<pre><code>cat /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc.conf | grep -i nfs
</code></pre>
<p>Edit the file.</p>
<pre><code>sudoedit /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Reboot probably required.</p>
