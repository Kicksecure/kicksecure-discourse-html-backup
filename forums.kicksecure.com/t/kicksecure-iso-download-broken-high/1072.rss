    <description>Hello Devs and Kicksecure Community,

I&#39;m writing this post to bring to the attention that the Kicksecure ISO release 17.3.9.9 download appears to be broken.

This is how I got to this conclusion and the steps I took first.

First I downloaded it on Ubuntu via the Mullvad Browser and it made it to 1.0 GB then failed. So I remembered that Mullvad Browser uses their own DNS regardless if you have the Mullvad VPN or not. So I turned off their DOH settings and again it failed.

Then I freshly installed Firefox and again it fails at about 1.0 GB of the download. That made me think it was a Firefox thing, so next I tried with Brave Browser and same thing failed at the 1.0 GB mark. The ISO appears to slightly bigger then 1.0 GB. Mind you I checked my free space and despite having 173 GB of free space it failed so obliviously more then enough.

Next I tried downloading other Linux distro ISO&#39;s and all of them fully downloaded. To test my next theory I switched/tried multiple DNS servers and again failed to download Kicksecure successfully. 

Lastly I wanted to try another system to see if it was something I did so I booted up a Tails usb to download the Kicksecure ISO and again it failed despite me having more then enough RAM available (16GB).

This is really concerning cause in the past I downloaded one of the first Kicksecure ISO&#39;s with no issue. My mind wants to go to the worst possible outcome, which I hope is not the case. Hopefully this is just a configuration issue on the server that hands out the downloads. 

This needs to be looked into and investigated to see whats going on.</description>

            <p>Can confirm that the stable ISO on download page fails to download from a standard connection on Librewolf. Also fails on tb-starter Tor Browser.</p>
<p>Why are the mirrors not listed on the ISO wiki download page?</p>
