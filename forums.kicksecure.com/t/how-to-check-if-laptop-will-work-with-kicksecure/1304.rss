            <p>I run Kicksecure on a corebooted Chromebook with 2gb ram and an Intel Celeron. Rest assured that whatever laptop you choose (as long as it’s within the last 10-15 years) will do just fine!</p>

            <p>Kicksecure is based on Debian, so virtually any hardware that works with Debian will work with Kicksecure also (provided none of our hardening settings interact poorly with the hardware). As for testing compatibility, the best way to do that is to boot the system from a Kicksecure live USB, then boot the system from that and ensure it works to your satisfaction within the live environment before installing. See:</p>

<p>There isn’t a Kicksecure hardware compatibility list at the moment, so there isn’t a way to check compatibility before you buy other than searching for reports on the Web of other Debian or Kicksecure users using the same machine.</p>
