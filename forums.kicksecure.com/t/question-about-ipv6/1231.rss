    <title>Question about IPv6</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/question-about-ipv6/1231</link>
    <description>Hey everyone! I am not sure if this the best place to post this, so if it is not, sorry in advance.

I am trying to configure reticulum which is a new kind of decentralized network and it auto connects over IPv6 to other nodes on the network. 

When I checked if IPv6 was enabled in Kicksecure, it says it is not. 

Reading the docs, I found this on the DNS security page:
/wiki/DNS_Security

&quot; * The user&#39;s computer has a local IPv6 but no actual IPv6 connectivity which might confuse DNS resolvers such as `unbound`.&quot;

My question is: is it safe to enable IPv6?

Why is turned off by default, and should I take any additional security/privacy measures if I decide to enable it?</description>
