    <description>Hi,

I upgraded some of my Kicksecure based TemplateVM from 16 to 17 using the release-upgrade way. After it was upgraded and restarted, I noticed that both my monitor were merged together instead of being separated. Here&#39;s an example:

Kicksecure-16 Template xrandr:
```
Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 1920x1080+1920+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
DUMMY1 connected 1920x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13 +
   QB1920x1080   59.96* 
```

Kicksecure-17 Template xrandr:
```
Screen 0: minimum 64 x 64, current 3840 x 1080, maximum 32767 x 32767
DUMMY0 connected primary 3840x1080+0+0 0mm x 0mm
   QB3840x1080   46.13*+
DUMMY1 disconnected
```

For some reason, morphing a debian-12 Template to Kicksecure-17 can&#39;t replicate the issue, only upgrading from Kicksecure 16 to 17 (Debian 11 to 12) can do it.
I checked all x11 dependencies between the templates and installed a few missing packages but I&#39;m not able to fix this. What else can be done in this case?

Thank you!</description>

            <p>I cloned a fresh debian-11 template, morphed it to Kicksecure-16 and then upgraded it to Kicksecure-17 using release-upgrade and I have the issue again.</p>
<p>I cloned a fresh debian-11 template, did the same thing but instead I manually changed repos to bookworm and I upgraded using apt directly. After everything was done, I rebooted and xrandr gives the good values.</p>
<p>Somehow, release-upgrade is creating this issue.</p>

            <p>This issue is too complex. I won’t be able to help with this.</p>
<p>The only chance is that someone at Qubes can help with this.</p>

<p>I upgraded some normal TemplateVM/StandaloneVM from Debian 11 to 12 without issues too yesterday.<br>
All my Kicksecure upgraded TemplateVM from 16 to 17 have this screen issue. The only one that works is the one I morphed based on an existing Debian 12 Template. It seems like the issue is only happening when I upgrade from Kicksecure 16 to Kicksecure 17.</p>

<p>Likely reproducible by Debian 11 to 12 release upgrade too? In that case, it’s a Qubes issue and you need to redirect your question there.</p>
