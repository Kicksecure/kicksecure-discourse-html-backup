    <description>Trying to apply kicksecure&#39;s hardenings to Parrot Home edition (Vbox), but i ran into some problems. Here is the output:
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends kicksecure-cli-vm 
Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree... Done
Reading state information... Done
Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have
requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable
distribution that some required packages have not yet been created
or been moved out of Incoming.
The following information may help to resolve the situation:

The following packages have unmet dependencies:
 kicksecure-recommended-cli : Depends: libblockdev-crypto2 but it is not installable
 plymouth : Conflicts: console-common but 0.7.91 is to be installed
: Error, pkgProblemResolver::Resolve generated breaks, this may be caused by held packages.

Already tried and searched for many solutions, but none of them really solved my problem. Someone can help me?</description>
