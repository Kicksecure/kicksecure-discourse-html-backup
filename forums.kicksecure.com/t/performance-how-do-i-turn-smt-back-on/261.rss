    <title>Performance. How do I turn SMT back on?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/performance-how-do-i-turn-smt-back-on/261</link>
    <description>Hello.

My laptop is just an old toaster; it is a very low powered machine.  I currently cannot handle the security features of having SMT turned off.  I understand turning it back on poses a greater security risk, but at this point I&#39;d rather have a functional laptop.

How do I turn SMT back on?  Please save my old toaster!  My Old Trusty really needs that hyperthreading again.  Intel Core i5 (3rd generation) dual core + hyperthreading.

I think you guys have done wonders as far as security is concerned for the Linux desktop, and I pray for your continued success.

I wish adding your Kicksecure repo to an immutable distro like Vanilla OS was a simple and easy process.  Having atomic updates with Kicksecure&#39;s security layering would be my absolute dreamboat Linux distro!</description>

<p>Nice feature but I don’t think this is going to be possible for a Debian based distribution anytime soon.</p>
