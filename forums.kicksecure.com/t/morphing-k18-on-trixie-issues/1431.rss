    <title>Morphing K18 on Trixie issues</title>

    <description>Hey all, nooby question (eventually :grinning_face:) so apologies if I’ve asked wrong. 

Been trying to morph K18 on Trixie usb. Failed 4-5 times so far. Having fun though and learning stuff :grinning_face: 

Tried two different fast 1tb usbs, one with lvm encryption and one just lvm, no encryption. Used rufus and etcher. 

Trixie installs every time with just lxqt and Debian desktop environment. I follow the guide add the repo manually as not in extrepo for Trixie, then I run into issues once I reboot after installing K18. 

On first usb (A) bugs out after entering encryption password, asks for user login then fails to load lxqt and returns cli - don’t know how to start lxqt from cli. Or I run into lux swap file issue and no cli and no options. On second usb (B) K18 install failed as it couldn’t install security-misc and reported process error. Cli option to fix doesn’t fix. When I reboot it’s just into Trixie. 

I’m trying to discount my Trixie install choices as a factor. 

Question = Are there any dos/dont on the Trixie install which will screw up the k18 morph? 

Thanks for reading and any tips.</description>

<p>I bet this is because you have LVM between your filesystem and LUKS. The current LUKS detector  I believe requires the filesystem to be used <em>directly</em> on the LUKS volume, not with LVM between it. Fixing that might be possible, but right now LVM support in Kicksecure is pretty limited (mainly because we can’t get an installer that supports LVM; we had debian-installer support for a while but had to remove it due to security issues in live-build when downloading debian-installer.)</p>
<p>If instead of installing from the Debian netinstaller, you install from a Debian Live LXQt image, does it work any better? That will let you use LUKS without LVM.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply, much appreciated. Tried again on a Trixie install from yesterday.</p>
<p>After entering passphrase to unencrypt I get two lines from swapfile creator</p>
<p>Info: swapfile creator….</p>
<p>Info: File /var/swapfile on LUKS encrypted device: ‘no’. - Doing nothing, ok.</p>
<p>encryption worked on bare Trixie but not after kicksecure.</p>
<p>Does setting up/not setting up root during Trixie install have any impact on kicksecure install? I followed all the steps in the notes right. But after switching to root before K18 install im not 100% sure it’s right as I get root /home/user# and the echo PATH don’t match the full path ( like in notes). Could all be wrong but just asking anyways.</p>

            <p>It’s hard to determine what’s going wrong here without knowing the exact error messages. Sometimes the same thing can fail the same way with two different error messages, and the details of those error messages indicate radically different solutions needed for each case, so it’s very helpful if you share the exact error messages you’re seeing, if any. (Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce an issue are also useful.)</p>
<p>What’s the LUKS swap file issue? What error message are you being shown?</p>
<p>Similarly, what’s the error message you’re running into with security-misc?</p>
<p>For the issue with graphical login, try logging in at a CLI login prompt, then run <code>/usr/libexec/desktop-config-dist/start-lxqt-session</code>. This is the command usually used “under the hood” to start LXQt. What error messages, if any, does this show? Or does it give you an LXQt desktop?</p>
