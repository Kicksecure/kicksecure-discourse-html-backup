    <description>### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 18.0.8.7

Install medium:    Sandisk USB

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted) + LUKS

Bios:		   Coreboot

Hey folks,

I recently gave Brave a spin and the browser‑choice panel worked flawlessly, very cool thanks!

However, when I tried to install Chromium through the same panel, it stalled for several minutes with no progress shown in the terminal. I restarted the process a few times, but the result was the same: a blank, black screen.

The only method that finally succeeded was a manual installation `sudo apt install --no-recommends chromium chromium-sandbox`

The installation is quite long for chromium as opposed for Brave. Could this be a Wayland related issue? When I install Chromium manually, I see status updates, but the browser‑choice UI gives me nothing but darkness in the term emulator.</description>

            <p>This worked for me the last time I tried it. Do you have a password set on the sysmaint account? If so, maybe the password authentication window was hiding underneath the browser-choice window.</p>
