    <title>Illegal instruction &quot;wc -l&quot;</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/illegal-instruction-wc-l/1314</link>
    <description>Hello,

I have recently installed Kicksecure and keep getting the same error when doing a system update (this is using the system maintanance panel). Here is the output to terminal when initiating an update:

—

/usr/bin/sudo /usr/libexec/security-misc/apt-get-update
/usr/libexec/security-misc/pam-info: line 47: 2591 Done                    print ‘%s\\n’ ““
2592 Illegal instruction            (core dumped) | wc -l &gt; /dev/null
/usr/libexec/security-misc/pam-info: ERROR: command ‘wc’ test failed! Do not ignore this!

’wc’ can core dump. Example:
zsh: illegal hardware instruction (core dumped) wc -l
**Github issue link here**
/usr/libexec/security-misc/pam-info failed: exit code 1
Get:1 tor+…
Get:2 tor+…
…

The line with “github issue link here” has in reality a link to issue 5137 on the rspamd github repo (I cannot include the actual link here). I read through the issue but did not really find a solution in there.

I have also found a thread on the artix forum that seems to talk about this (just searching “wc -l core dump” gave me the result), but I did not really find a solution there either.

I have tried reinstalling the distro, without success.

I guess it is hardware related? My machine is about 9 years old, so to my understanding Debian should not really have any problems with it.

Thanks in advance for any help or suggestions!

Kind regards,
Henry</description>
