    <title>Cannot use split-u2f (yubikey website authentication)</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/cannot-use-split-u2f-yubikey-website-authentication/165</link>
    <description>From a debian-11-minimal I created the following templates:
`ks-16-firefox`:
```
debian-11-minimal ---&gt; ks-16-minimal ---&gt; ks-16-firefox
```
`debian-11-firefox`:
```
debian-11-minimal ---&gt; debian-11-firefox
```
The **only** difference between these two templates are the following packages:
```
hardened-malloc
haveged
jitterentropy-rngd
kicksecure-qubes-cli
security-misc
```

The other packages, including `qubes-u2f`, have been installed in both templates.

For practicality, I then created a DispVM Template for `debian-11-firefox` and another for `ks-16-firefox`.

The problem is that if I launch `firefox-esr` in a DispVM based off of `ks-16-firefox`, u2f authentication with a yubikey doesn&#39;t work. However, with the same settings and website, everything works fine in the DispVM based off of `debian-11-firefox`.</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Still made zero progress on this.</p>
<p>Could something in <code>security-misc</code> prevent <code>qubes-u2f</code> policies from working correctly?</p>
<p>Or maybe it’s preventing the browser from accessing it?</p>
<p>The yubikey is never actually attached to the dispvm and is instead attached to sys-usb, which uses a template based on kicksecure. And just to be very specific, everything works fine with firefox in normal debian-minimal dispvm.</p>
<p>Please advise, I really need this to work, any help welcome!</p>
