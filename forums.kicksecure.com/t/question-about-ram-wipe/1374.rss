    <title>Question about RAM Wipe</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/question-about-ram-wipe/1374</link>
    <description>I was following along on the kicksecure ram-wipe documentation for installing. and at the end it says:
***To wipe the LUKS full disk encryption (FDE) for the root disk from RAM it is required to unmount and root disk file system and close the root disk LUKS volume during the shutdown process.***

And thats where my issues arise. I installed the ram-wipe package to a Kali Linux VM, and the script works on shutdown. However it complains that there are still mounted encrypted disks.

How can you make it so that LUKS volumes get unmounted on shutdown so that ram wipe can do it’s thing?

            <p>Alright thanks for the info. I should mention that ram-wipe works fine on all my kicksecure machines, so its probably something that kali is doing different.</p>
<p>Have a good day!</p>

            <p>Thank you for the report!</p>
<p>Maybe you are in luck. This might be quite easy to fix.</p>
<p>dmsetup might have changed from stdout output “No devices found” to empty output on stdout.</p>
<p>Maybe “No devices found” is now on stderr output.</p>
<p>A new version will probably be released in the near future.</p>
