<li>in package <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/anon-apt-sources-list" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - Kicksecure/anon-apt-sources-list: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list for Security-Focused Linux Distributions</a>,</li>

<p>This IS anonymity. But knowing the IP address doesn’t make any difference? The massive scanners scans the whole internet all the time. Also, the signature of packages and reproducible builds of Debian will prevent supply chain attack.</p>

</aside>
<p>Reproducible builds prove that everyone <em>can</em> get the same clean binary from the published source, but they don’t stop a malicious/compromised update server from deciding to treat specific user(s) differently by sending them a different, targeted malicious upgrade. That’s why torified updates are still needed for protection against targeted attacks even if reproducible builds are in place.</p>

</aside>
<p>The presence of Tor on Kicksecure is purely for security reasons, not for anonymity. It makes it so that a user cannot be singled out to receive malicious software via normal software updates.

<p>I want to run Desktop and Server on a secure hardened Debian based system. But I don’t need Tor on some of the place.</p>

<p>Yes. For example I use Gnome on desktop. You can customize Gnome UI to make it looks like Mac OS X. And the system-monitor-next and Freon extension helps me to monitor the real time performance.</p>
<p>Neither Xfce nor LXDE can do it.</p>

            <p>This feels a bit like walking into an atomic power plant and suggesting how to redesign the reactor without knowing much about nuclear engineering. It’s not that the ideas lack enthusiasm or creativity, they just miss the depth rrequired to understand the complexities involved.</p>
<p>Complex systems are built on years of research and testing to balance functionality, stability, security. Making changes, like modularizing features or switching core components, isn’t as simple as it sounds. It involves considering dependencies, complexities, and how these changes could impact the core goals of the system.</p>
<p>The best way to contribute is to focus on areas where you can have a meaningful impact, like testing or documentation. Broad, surface-level ideas are a good starting point but without grounding in the system’s design, they can end up being a distraction rather than a help.</p>

            <p>I think <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> have a definition. *his definition</p>
<h1><a name="p-2040-draft-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-2040-draft-1"></a>Draft</h1>
<p>I just think the operating system is developing too fast, and lack a little grounding in the process. KS &amp; W are one operating system, not two (efficiency-wise).</p>
<p>KS = base (earth), W = extension (building).<br>
Without a strong and stable ‘earth’ / ‘ground’, how’s the ‘building’ even gonna hold up.</p>
<p>base = core<br>
extension = blending</p>
<p>We can have some sort of module to enable the ‘extension’. Take a look at slax(dot).org. Let’s build something similiar.</p>
<p>I’m typing kind of randomly because I’m flooded with idea that can draw more attention. Whonix is publically know to be better than Tails (most of the time). Tails and Whonix are well known. Whonix is second to QubesOS(the extreme). It is considered lighter in resource usage. Low End Computer can still take advantage of KickSecure.</p>
<p>Bear with me, Please plot mindmap and you’ll understand what I want to present.</p>
<p>Suggestion</p>
<ol>
<li>module based (features can be loaded and unloaded) (this can help to target people with specific requirement, strictest or not)</li>
<li>securityManager (all security related settings are only in here, so we don’t need package separation)</li>
<li>light on resources</li>
<li>To make the operating system beautiful, hire archcraft owner to do the beautifying job</li>
<li>Documenting can be hard, switch to arch based one day. Because every live mode will boot into a fresh state. We can take advantage of documented resources.</li>
<li>Make the operating system light enough to support copy2ram</li>
<li>Strip out bluetooth, audio by default. Can be reloaded via module.</li>
<li>Ship with Firefox ESR with strictest privacy options enable. No Extension Yet of course. It’s not hardening like arkenfox thing, but default settings after pulled to the max security.</li>
<li>coming soon.</li>
</ol>
<p>is heavy operating system really required to ensure security ? is what i’m really curious about. Not saying Whonix or KickSecure is heavy but hey it’s an improvement and the code base will be easy to manage, small &amp; efficient. Isn’t that what we want ? We’re the technology itself.</p>
