    <description>Hello everyone, after my power went out, I can’t log into WorkStation. When loading the system, the following errors are shown, which are visible on my screenshot. The data inside the system is very important to me, is there a way to extract it somehow?

<p>That sounds like the filesystem was corrupted by an improper shutdown (which would happen if the power went out). On the bright side, It’s very unlikely the filesystem is so corrupted that the data on it is inaccessible.</p>
<p>Probably the best course of action is to create a new virtual machine, then attach the old virtual machine’s disk to the new virtual machine. Then you can open the drive and copy your files to the new VM.</p>
