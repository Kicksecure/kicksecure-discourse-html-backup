    <title>Setcap notice when upgrading</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/setcap-notice-when-upgrading/622</link>
    <description>Beginner question. I see this notice when upgrading “run: setcap -r — /bin/ping”. I tried to run that and it says “unable to set CAP_SETFCAP effective capability: operation not permitted” … I’m tempted to try running it with sudo, but I remember reading some kicksecure post advising against blindly using sudo. Someone please tell me what to do.</description>
