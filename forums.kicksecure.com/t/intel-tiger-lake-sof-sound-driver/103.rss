    <description>Hello!
I&#39;m new to KickSecure and trying to get sound back on my laptop.
I had installed the Intel Tiger Lake SOF driver easily in Debian Bullseye, but in KickSecure its not so easy.  Not exactly sure why, but here is the output of the Intel Install.SH

user@debian:/lib/firmware/sof-bin-v2.2$ sudo ./install.sh 1.7
+ ln -sT sof-1.7 /lib/firmware/intel/sof
+ ln -sT sof-tplg-1.7 /lib/firmware/intel/sof-tplg
+ rsync -a ./sof*1.7 /lib/firmware/intel/
rsync: link_stat &quot;/usr/lib/firmware/sof-bin-v2.2/sof*1.7&quot; failed: No such file or directory (2)
rsync error: some files/attrs were not transferred (see previous errors) (code 23) at main.c(1207) [sender=3.1.3]</description>

            <p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>It was 1.8 inside the folder, but nowhere in the ReadMe could I get the right version.  Neither was the version online.  I just had to go in the folder of what would not install.</p>
<p>It worked, thanks!</p>

<p>I highly doubt that’s a Kicksecure specific issue. If rsync reports the<br>
file/folder doesn’t exist, chances are it really doesn’t.</p>
<p>Meaning, the install.sh script could be broken.</p>
