    <description>### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 17.4.4.6

Install medium:    Sandisk USB

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted)

---

This post is about what I believe to be called the Volume Manager plugin.

* System volumes shown

After install I noticed the “Removable Media” plugin on the lxqt panel in the upper right corner shows `/boot`, `/rootfs`, and `/efi` as mount points. Can the widget be told to ignore system or not show system volumes? I can see users accidentally unmounting these.

* “Removable Media” showing on center of desktop at boot

After I booted I saw the panel plugin the center of screen as if it was a desktop icon but after like 5 seconds it disappeared. My guess is it is a bug with Wayland? Thought I would mention it.</description>
