    <description>### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 18.0.8.7

Install medium:    Sandisk USB

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted) + LUKS

Bios:		   Coreboot

---

I’ll need to double check my notes, but the Syscheck notification popup error reports “FDE absent” when booting into Live Mode. My guess is that Live Mode running as a regular USER lacks the necessary privileges to perform the check. I selected FDE and selected LUKS at install. LUKS passphrase is still needed before I get anywhere, so it works. Luks was unlocked long before and I selected FDE in the installer and my files are decrypted so LUKS is present I would think?

Additionally, the Syscheck error notification can be quite annoying when operating in Live Mode as a USER. To get it to go away you have to mask it first in non Live Mode.
I don’t mind it normally poping up for USER in normal mode but for Live Mode I could do without it tbh.

Would it even be possible to disable or mask the service for user in live mode (Not sysmaint), and would it make sense? Avoiding seeing after a new install after booting into user in live mode, while still showing it in normal session for user (they would still have the option to do systemctl --user mask updatecheck.service)

If we apply this would it also prevent the “Live Check Indicator” systray icon (the yellow circle) from appearing or is that unrelated to this?</description>

<p>That’s a good point. Probably best to keep it as-is then.</p>

<p>Not sure if that’s what you were asking for. Generally, Kicksecure is highly customizable.<br>

<p>What’s the suggestion? No longer autostart systemcheck and/or updatecheck in live mode?</p>
<p>I think the should keep autostarting systemcheck in live mode. Technically it’s not autostarted directly yet. systemcheck gets started conditionally by setup-wizard-dist.</p>
<p>Maybe one day we’d want to (re-)introduce a <code>systemcheck.service</code> systemd unit.</p>
<p>I am not saying we necessarily need to insist on showing a popup. systemcheck could be tailored to be non-intrusive, more suitable in live mode.</p>
<p>Some checks such as <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck#Journal_Inspection_and_Diagnostics_Logs">Journal Inspection and Diagnostics Logs</a> pointing out  “Bad RAM detected” or “self-detected stall on CPU”, which are severe and likely to cause follow-up issues should be reported if found.</p>

<p>Is your system fully up-to-date? We fixed this bug some time back, and the fix is in Kicksecure 18’s stable repository, so a normal software update should resolve the issue. (We haven’t published new Kicksecure images with the fix already present yet.)</p>

<p>That’s an unrelated tool called “livecheck”. That will still appear as it should even if systemcheck is suppressed in live mode.</p>
