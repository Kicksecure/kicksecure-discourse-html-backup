    <title>Systemcheck shows FDE absent in Live Mode (18.0.8.7 Feedback)</title>

    <description>### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 18.0.8.7

Install medium:    Sandisk USB

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted) + LUKS

Bios:		   Coreboot

---

I’ll need to double check my notes, but the Syscheck notification popup error reports “FDE absent” when booting into Live Mode. My guess is that Live Mode running as a regular USER lacks the necessary privileges to perform the check. I selected FDE and selected LUKS at install. LUKS passphrase is still needed before I get anywhere, so it works. Luks was unlocked long before and I selected FDE in the installer and my files are decrypted so LUKS is present I would think?

Additionally, the Syscheck error notification can be quite annoying when operating in Live Mode as a USER. To get it to go away you have to mask it first in non Live Mode.
I don’t mind it normally poping up for USER in normal mode but for Live Mode I could do without it tbh.

Would it even be possible to disable or mask the service for user in live mode (Not sysmaint), and would it make sense? Avoiding seeing after a new install after booting into user in live mode, while still showing it in normal session for user (they would still have the option to do systemctl --user mask updatecheck.service)

If we apply this would it also prevent the “Live Check Indicator” systray icon (the yellow circle) from appearing or is that unrelated to this?</description>

<p>Is your system fully up-to-date? We fixed this bug some time back, and the fix is in Kicksecure 18’s stable repository, so a normal software update should resolve the issue. (We haven’t published new Kicksecure images with the fix already present yet.)</p>

<p>That’s not a bad idea, and would likely be easy to implement. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> thoughts?</p>

<p>That’s an unrelated tool called “livecheck”. That will still appear as it should even if systemcheck is suppressed in live mode.</p>
