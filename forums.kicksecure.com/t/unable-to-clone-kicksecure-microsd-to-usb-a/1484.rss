    <title>Unable to clone Kicksecure MicroSD to USB-A</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unable-to-clone-kicksecure-microsd-to-usb-a/1484</link>
    <description>Hi all,

My attempts to clone a functional Persistent install of KS from a 64GB MicroSD card to a 64GB USB-A drive have failed.

While all seems well and the cloned drive’s Boot Menu appears and works, the thing times-out trying to ‘access’ the LUKS password procededure. i.e. the password request just doesn’t happen. and the device spasms about with various error codes and, eventually, crashes.

The ‘source’ card remains fine.

I’m assuming ‘hidden’ files issues or similar during cloning?

Advice appreciated.

Cheers</description>

            <p>Bingo!</p>
<p>MicroSD card (source) 63,864,etc., USB-A drive (destination) 62,495,etc.</p>
<p>So, the other way WOULD work then, I guess…</p>
<p>Mmmm, stubborn little things aren’t they.</p>
<p>Thanks again arraybolt3.</p>

            <p>Check the exact size of the SD card and the USB drive in bytes. If the SD card is actually 63.124 and the USB is 63.120 GB, you’re effectively cloning a larger drive to a smaller one, in which case you will lose whatever was at the end of the drive (including the backup partition table and possibly filesystem structures), and will probably confuse filesystem drivers as well.</p>
<p>If you are running into a “larger-to-smaller” clone issue, you can try to shrink the root partition on the SD card a bit so it will fit on the USB drive. <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41093/535873">https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/41093/535873</a> may help, but keep in mind this comes with a very high risk of destroying the Kicksecure installation on the SD card. You might find it easier to reinstall from scratch.</p>
