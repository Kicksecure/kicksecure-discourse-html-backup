            <p>Thanks for help.<br>
As newcomer from archlinux, things seems different here.<br>
Unfortunately there is no video demonstrating this like i did with archiso to build custom ISO ,<br>
If  you have any youtube video to start with  incl calamares setting etc</p>
<p>Otherwise i will give best effort to go thorough all related wiki and your posted steps above</p>

            <p>You should be able to add any additional packages you want to <code>derivative-maker/live-build-data/live-build-config/live_build_package_list_kicksecure</code>. The format of this file is pretty simple, each package goes on its own line, lines that start with <code>#</code> are comments. There are placeholders that are handled specially by the build process, but that’s the extent of the “fancy” processing that is done. Packages will be installed in the order specified in the file, so generally speaking it’s safest to add additional packages to the end of the file.</p>
<p>Once you’ve added the packages you want, commit your changes (<code>git add -A &amp;&amp; git commit -m 'checkpoint'</code>), then <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/images" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">run derivative-maker like you normally would</a>. You will be given one error due to the fact that your commit is untagged - this is normal, and you can safely press <kbd>c</kbd> followed by <kbd>Enter</kbd> to ignore the error.</p>
