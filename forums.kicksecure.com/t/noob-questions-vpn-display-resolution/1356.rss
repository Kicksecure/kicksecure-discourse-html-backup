    <title>Noob questions VPN/Display resolution</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/noob-questions-vpn-display-resolution/1356</link>
    <description>Hi,

Trying to install kicksecure, however before I connect to the internet id like to install a VPN. Managed to do it by entering Sysmaint, mount the usb, copy files to /media/ install the .deb file.

However, I have a question. Now that I have a VPN installed in sysmaint (and host user). Will all traffic be router by the vpn, even clearnet/APT upgrades?

Do I first need to launch the VPN in sysmaint - before updating packages/software for it to cover the APT traffic? ISP → VPN → Clearnet/Tor 

Regarding the Display. I only get 1200x*800 in resolution, no other suggestions. I figured it is a driver issue*…? Linux Mint shows alot of resolutions per default. Not kicksecure. *Kicksecure is using MESA drivers and my display (1920 x 1080) is not found. I tried force set display with xrandr but doesnt work. Just throws error codes. How do I switch/change to Nouveau drivers? Or does it not having enrolled the secure boot key therefor preventing Nouveau drivers to load? I have read the nouveau drivers should be included in the linux mainkernel by default. My linux mint test-install showed indeed Nouveau drivers was in use.*

Keep in mind im a total noob to linux. Trying to make the switch to more secure software after having trouble with hacker attacks and malware in windows.</description>
