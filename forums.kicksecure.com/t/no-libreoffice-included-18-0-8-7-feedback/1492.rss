    <title>No LibreOffice Included? (18.0.8.7 Feedback)</title>

    <description>### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 18.0.8.7

Install medium:    Sandisk USB (Baremetal no virtualization)

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted) + LUKS

Bios:		   Coreboot

---

So I noticed LibreOffice is not packaged with Kicksecure?

Please bundle a minimal LibreOffice installation with the most common language packs for North‑American and European users, plus dictionary and thesaurus plug‑ins.

```
sudo apt install --no-install-recommends \
    libreoffice-writer \
    libreoffice-l10-en-us \
    hungspell-us-en-us \
    mythes-en-us
```

This is how I installed LibreOffice with document editor alone minimally with dictionary/thesaurus plugin dependency for English only.


(**Anyone following along can use the installation command (minimal writer‑only setup, English only above**)

For the distro to include all packs with a wildcard like libreoffice-l10-\* would increase size too much so which I would assume is why it wasn’t included to keep ISO size small. With english packs alone for my minimal install it was ~~150~~ 318MB. Where as if you choose more then english it would be 400MB-600MB roughly I would suppose.</description>

            <p>318 MB is a lot; our ISO is around 1244 MB at the moment, and while squashfs compression would reduce the size of LibreOffice a lot, it’s still quite a bit of additional bytes (which can make a big difference when it comes to download costs, though I don’t know how much the server hosting costs). It’s simple enough to install the way you did it, some users will want other components like Calc, Draw, Impress, etc. and many users likely don’t have a use for it.</p>
