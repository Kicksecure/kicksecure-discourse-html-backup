    <title>Persistent GRUB Boot Issue with Kicksecure and Multiple SSDs</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/persistent-grub-boot-issue-with-kicksecure-and-multiple-ssds/1066</link>
    <description>I initially installed Kicksecure on an SSD in my PC and used it without any issues. After shutting down my PC and removing that SSD, I installed a different Linux distribution on another SSD, which also worked perfectly. However, when I turned off my PC and attempted to boot back into Kicksecure, it only loaded into GRUB, necessitating a reinstallation of GRUB on the Kicksecure installation. This problem recurs every time I boot into another operating system, forcing me to reinstall GRUB to use Kicksecure again.

How can I resolve this issue to avoid repeatedly reinstalling GRUB to use Kicksecure, while still being able to use other operating systems from different SSDs on my PC? Could this issue be related to my BIOS settings, and if so, what specific settings should I check or modify in the BIOS to fix it?
