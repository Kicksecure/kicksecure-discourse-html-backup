            <p>This is not a documented command for the purpose of full system deletion. So this is a non-starter.</p>
<p>There are a ton of files the API file systems (<code>/dev</code>, <code>/proc</code>, <code>/sys</code>) and deletion of all of that might have unintended consequences as this is not intended that users are running that command.</p>
<p>That command is more of a joke / saying uses in some contexts. Not an actual feature of Linux. No system can completely delete itself. <code>/</code> is the root filesystem. It contains all, even the live system living in RAM itself.</p>
<p>This isn’t a useful test.</p>
<p>If you want to test that anyhow for curiosity without risk of wrecking your system, try it inside a VM. Images for various VMs are conveniently provided on the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Download">download page</a>.</p>

<p>“very secure” can mean many things. I don’t know who told you what exactly. Best to refer to what the documentation is saying.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grub-live - boot an existing Host OS or VM into Live Mode</a></h3>

  <p>Add a Live Mode entry to the grub boot menu on your existing Debian host platform. Stop Persistent Malware. Read-only mode. Make all writes go to non-persistent storage (RAM) instead of the hard disk.</p>

<p>There is a lot documentation which might be creating an unintended magic aura but what technically happens is what it interesting. This is documented in chapter <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live#Developer_Information">grub-live, Developer Information</a>. For comprehensive understanding, study the source code.</p>
<p>grub-live doesn’t claim to be a perfect sandbox. It’s “only” enabling live mode, non-persistence. How malware might interact with grub-live is also documented in the wiki.</p>
