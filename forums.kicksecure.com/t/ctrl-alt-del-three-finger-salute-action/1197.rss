    <description>**Ctrl+Alt+Del** (sometimes called the &quot;[three-finger salute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-Alt-Delete)&quot;):

On Windows, the three-finger does something useful. Noways, shows a menu:

* Lock
* Switch user
* Sign out
* Change a password
* Task manager
* Cancel

On Qubes, simply activates the screen lock.

On Kicksecure, we could also provide similar options such as:

* Task manager
* Lock
* Regular shutdown
* Emergency shutdown</description>

            <p>What about other default shortcuts like <em>super key</em> for whisker menu for easy searching for applications like “windows task bar”. Many distros already set super key for application menu like Ubuntu and Mint.</p>

            <p>My idea was to use the existing emerg-shutdown framework (which monitors for a “panic” key combo already) to also act as the Ctrl+Alt+Delete handler. That would make it work anywhere in the system, and could also (if handled carefully) prevent malware running as a local user from being able to interfere with the key handler and associated features.</p>

            <p>Please see my thread 1147 about this.</p>
<p>My question is what route should be the go to?</p>
<p>Set a local shortcuts config for user and sysmaint? Downside would be these keyboard shortcuts would not populate if user uses sysmaint to create more users. Unless there is something specific to xfce4’s xconf for globally setting shortcuts it seems like the only route is dconf?</p>
