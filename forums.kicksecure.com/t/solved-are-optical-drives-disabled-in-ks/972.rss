    <title>[SOLVED] Are Optical Drives disabled in KS?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/solved-are-optical-drives-disabled-in-ks/972</link>
    <description>I morphed my Debian into Kicksecure on an old Macbook. Before, the optical drive worked fine, now it&#39;s not recognized at all (&quot;eject&quot; and &quot;lsblk&quot; don&#39;t list it).
My understanding is that the kernel KS uses is the same as Debian, but I also found that some kernel drivers a blocklisted for security reasons (such as firewire because it would enable known exploits).
The problem is that I rely on the optical drive. Is there any way to enable it?

Edit: I found this: /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf
Any idea which one is needed for and Apple MacBook2,1 SuperDrive?

SOLVED: by commenting out these lines:
blacklist cdrom
blacklist sr_mod

in:
/etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_blacklist.conf

EDIT:
Also had to allow the udf filesystem.</description>
