    <title>TOTP based Authenticators fail if sdwdate is not synced</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/totp-based-authenticators-fail-if-sdwdate-is-not-synced/1154</link>
    <description>Just wanted to post this here for other users that may using keepassxc with TOTP and it failing to spit out correct codes related to sdwdate issue bellow. 

I went to set up TOTP inside keepassxc and it kept failing to give the right codes. This led me to figure out that the time has to be correct for it to work properly.

Since I was using a VPN auto connect it would sometimes cause sdwdate to time out due to [VPN -&gt; Tor -&gt; sdwdate] slow connection or whatnot.

Once I synced sdwdate the issue was resolved.</description>
