    <title>Some questions before switching</title>

    <description>Hi there

I’m currently using endeavour os on two computers(one with additional nvidia GPU and the other one just with integrated intel’s). I like it mainly because:

1. it never breaks(like after updates etc) and I used different ones before that(ubuntu, fedora, manjaro etc). This one I use on both computers like over 2 years now and with no issues.
2. for the nvidia GPU laptop I don’t need to think what to do each time something is not right etc. The drivers just work (I use the nvidia’s drivers the system suggest to install).

BUT… despite I use hardened kernel, I know that kicksecure is probably way more secure and much more privacy respected system. That’s why I wanna switch, but the above two things are stopping me from it.

Can you please clarify the two points above, because I’m not really a techie and don’t wanna deal with all the under-stuff. I just want my system to just work and be as secure and private as possible.

I feel like when I’ll install it I’ll end up switching back because I will need to pull my hairs off again dealing with the nvidia GPU drivers or that some day after an update the system will not boot or something will not work and again I will pull my hairs off.

P.S: forgot to mention that I use KDE plasma and highly used to it, in case it matters somehow</description>

<p>Kicksecure is based on Debian, which has “don’t break on upgrades” as one of its core goals. Sometimes a change to Kicksecure will introduce a bug which could introduce brief “breakage”, but we usually notice and fix those promptly.</p>

<p>I’m not aware of any testing being done to ensure Kicksecure works well on NVIDIA hardware, so your mileage may vary there. Instructions for installation should be the same as for Debian:</p>

<p>You can use Kicksecure with other desktop environments, but keep in mind that we primarily test and provide security and usability enhancements for the “stock” desktop environment in Kicksecure. In Kicksecure 17, that desktop is Xfce + X11, while in Kicksecure 18, it will be LXQt + labwc (Wayland).</p>
<p>You might consider trying out Kicksecure in a virtual machine before installing it on your hardware. Prebuilt VM images are available for VirtualBox (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/VirtualBox" class="inline-onebox">Kicksecure for Windows, macOS, Linux inside VirtualBox</a>) and KVM (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/KVM" class="inline-onebox">Kicksecure for KVM</a>).</p>
