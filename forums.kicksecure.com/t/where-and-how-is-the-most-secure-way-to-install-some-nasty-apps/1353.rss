    <description>I wanna install yandex browser and I’m pretty sure it’s kinda nasty thing. I wanna install it for my mom as she’s fluent with russian and yandex has youtube audio translations for russians etc… don’t ask.
anyways, what’s the best way to install it? I mean it’s kinda scary to install it as it is, maybe there’s some recommended way to do so(so the GPU’s acceleration will still work etc)?</description>

            <p>This brings me back when using yandex browser as a OSINT browser lol good stuff. There is a “unofficial” appimage and flakpak version of it but I would be leary tbh with you.</p>
<p>There is two ways that I could think of doing it that don’t require virtual machine, the second would more of a setup. Either way would require you to create a new non sudor user for you’re “mother”.</p>
<hr>
<p>One way you “might” be able to do this, I could have sworn I did this with a .deb file of some software back in the day but it wasn’t a browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make a local dir in the “mother” user account /<br>
<code>mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/yandex-browser"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the .deb and instead of installing it system wide try extracting it. /</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre data-code-wrap="sh"><code class="lang-sh">dpkg-deb -x yandex-browser.deb "$HOME/.local/yandex-browser
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Then find the binary is in the directory and launch it, then you would need to make a desktop shortcut for the command.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The other way would be installing the yandex browser in a Docker container and then after creating desktop shortcut that launches it with a x11 display.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really don’t know why you dont just install a separate more trustable browser then yandex and install some kind of translate extension???</p>
