    <title>Where and how is the most secure way to install some nasty apps?</title>

    <description>I wanna install yandex browser and I’m pretty sure it’s kinda nasty thing. I wanna install it for my mom as she’s fluent with russian and yandex has youtube audio translations for russians etc… don’t ask.
anyways, what’s the best way to install it? I mean it’s kinda scary to install it as it is, maybe there’s some recommended way to do so(so the GPU’s acceleration will still work etc)?</description>
