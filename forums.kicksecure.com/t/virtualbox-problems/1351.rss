    <description>So i have i think i manged to uninstall and reinstall virtualbox x10 times to try to circumvent the rather annoying problem of it instantly hanging as soon as i try to start it. The corrupt whonix.osa VM or whatever it is must still be i dunno jammed inside it? I also deleted the files of the vm image inside the home/usr folder but to no avail. I can’t access the error code right now however i will be back (which is the same one on the well known list) yeah i know but i can’t find anything like this and am half demented by this point .. took me ages last year to set it up and been months since i could get near it :frowning: Please help</description>

            <ul>
<li>Are you sure your downloaded Whonix <code>.ova</code> image is uncorrupted? You can use GPG to verify the image if you aren’t sure, or you can try downloading the image from scratch.</li>
<li>Did you delete the VMs themselves from VirtualBox, or only the disk image files? You need to delete the VMs themselves to get VirtualBox to forget them entirely, you can do this by right-clicking on the VM you wish to delete, and clicking “Remove…”.</li>
<li>What host OS are you using? If you’re on Windows, you may need to disable Hyper-V to prevent VirtualBox VMs from stalling on boot. See <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-only-starts-after-several-attempt-rcpu-preempt-self-detected-stall-on-cpu/22032/8:">https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-only-starts-after-several-attempt-rcpu-preempt-self-detected-stall-on-cpu/22032/8:</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to try to disable Hyper-V. Windows 11 Pro makes this ridiculously hard: I had to disable it in at least four different places in order to get it to actually go away:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off</code></li>
<li><code>dism /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V</code></li>
<li>Windows Security → Device Security → Core Isolation → Turn off “Memory integrity”</li>
<li>Registry Editor → Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard → Set EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity to 0</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing all of that, VirtualBox started showing a blue microchip icon instead of a green turtle in the lower-right corner of VM windows, and at that point all of the hanging issues appeared to stop. I was able to launch Whonix-Gateway, Whonix-Workstation, and Kicksecure all at the same time, none of them hung and all of them seemed to be booting faster.</p>
