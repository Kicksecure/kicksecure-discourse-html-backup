    <description>Browser (Brave &amp; Tor) were downloaded and extracted to a external folder which is mounted on /mnt. These tools are installed for portability as I do not use KickSecure only. 

They work outside of KickSecure, which got me questioning...

What&#39;s the catch ?</description>

<p>Yes, though I think you need to point config to <code>/boot/grub/persistence.conf</code> in the case of the Kali example (Correct me if I’m wrong):<br>
<code>echo -e '/home/user/.electrum source=electrum' | sudo tee -a /boot/grub/persistence.conf &gt; /dev/null</code></p>
<p>In Kali Linux, persistence is configured by editing the persistence.conf file located at <code>/boot/grub/persistence.conf</code>. Persistent data is stored under <code>/media/persistence/</code>, which is a common location for mounting removable media.</p>
<p>In Tails, persistence is managed within the live environment. The configuration file persistence.conf is located at <code>/live/persistence/TailsData_unlocked/persistence.conf</code>. This setup allows Tails to maintain privacy by keeping persistent data within the live system structure.</p>

            <p>There is a tool included in or from MX linux can’t remember it’s been a long time since used it. To get to the gist of it, it is a GUI tool that can be used to clone a live running existing system. Meaning you can boot into live and install packages and make modifications you want then clone the live running system as a ISO or to another drive.</p>

            <p>Does this make all changes to the “live” system persistent, or only changes to a particular directory? I’m virtually 100% sure Dracut can do the former (see the rd.live.overlay option on <a href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/dracut.cmdline.7.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">dracut.cmdline(7) - Linux manual page</a>). The latter could be done with an fstab tweak, though that would require you to change the fstab in the ISO image which would mean you’d have to build the ISO yourself using derivative-maker. The process for building a Kicksecure ISO is documented at <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Build_Documentation/VM" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Kicksecure ™ VM Build Documentation</a>.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for sharing these knowledge, but I wonder why the exact same applications works with the same permission on other main stream distributions. Do you know what’s the root of the problem ?</p>
<p>For your information, they do run / execute but got ‘permission denied’ all the time. It can be hard to describe it through words, so please try to replicate it.</p>
<p><em>Update</em>: Changing permission code was what I did when I suspect that might be some kind of KickSecure hardening. Just an experiment.</p>

            <p>The running operating system is <strong>KickSecure</strong> and the partition was created during one of the session, So I trust the files &amp; operating system. The differences between the output of the specified software in different distribution is that <strong>KS</strong> basically output ‘<em>permission denied</em>’ while others runs them without any issue.</p>
<p>Recreating the issue can be rather simple. (# before line indicate it is to run with <code>sudo</code>)</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># fdisk /dev/sdx; (input: 'n', 'enter'*2, '+4G', 'w')

            <p>If the OS has malware that is running as root / administrator / SYSTEM / some other highly privileged user account depending on the particular OS you’re working with, then yes. Read-only flags are enforced in software only, and anything with high privileges on a system can turn off or even just ignore those flags. So if you’re going to do this, you should only share the drive between systems you trust to not have malware on them.</p>
