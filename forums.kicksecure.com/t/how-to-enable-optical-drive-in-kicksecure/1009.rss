    <title>How to enable optical drive in kicksecure?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/how-to-enable-optical-drive-in-kicksecure/1009</link>
    <description>I tried out the steps in this guide https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/solved-are-optical-drives-disabled-in-ks/972

But it didnt work, i might have disabled the UDF filesystem when editing the /etc/modprobe.d/30_security-misc_disable.conf

currently it is written like this: install udf /usr/bin/disabled-filesys-by-security-misc

idk if that means it is enabled or disabled. if it is disabled, is putting comments back onto the line all you have to do to enable? i have a feeling you have to remove the file &quot;disabled-filesys-by-security-misc&quot; but i figured i should ask here before trying anything.

all help is appreciated. the optical drive im using is the asus zen drive U9M and has worked out of the box on my laptop running Parrot OS.</description>
