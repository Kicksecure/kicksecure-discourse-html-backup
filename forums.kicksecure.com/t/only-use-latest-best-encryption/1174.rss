        <title>Only Use Latest/Best Encryption</title>

            <p>Practical limitation: Subject to limitations of Kicksecure base operating system and the current release version being based on.</p>
<p>We can demand users to stay reasonably up-to-date.</p>
<p>Less confusing highly technical options means better usability, so whenever sensible yes. If we can reasonably make this decision, yes. For example,</p>
<ul>
<li>we’re not going to add an encryption option for 3DES to our Calamares installer if someone requests that. Even if contributed, that won’t happen → <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Declined" class="inline-onebox">Declined Feature Requests</a>.</li>
<li>if we conclude to have identified the latest / best encryption algorithm and it’s a clear choice, we’ll use that as default.</li>
<li>if there are multiple great choices but no best can be identified, it’s being a controversial choice, and there are a lot users requesting both options, we will probably provide options.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s not easy to have a general policy that foresees everything. This will need to be decided on a by case basis depending on the component in question.</p>
<p>And performance may also play a role.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we use AES? Or a cascade AES-Twofish-Serpent by default? Some performance tests will be needed.</li>
<li>What if there was a cascade of 50 [1] (or you name it how many) algorithims or some super new algorithm on steriods that has a performance reduction of 99% - which in result would mean booting the system would now take several hours… We wouldn’t use that. Feasibility, practicality, performance considerations will remain to play a role.
