    <title>Veracrypt containers do not open</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/veracrypt-containers-do-not-open/1091</link>
    <description>The last time i played around with veracrypt was back in January, so i know they worked on whatever version was back then. When i try to open a container vera asks for admin password. When i press enter the password window closes but the container is not opening.
If i set up a password and enter it it says that the password is wrong.

I tried both the app image and installing it:
sudo apt install dirmngr software-properties-common apt-transport-https curl lsb-release ca-certificates -y 

curl -fsSL https://notesalexp.org/debian/alexp_key.asc | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/alexp_key.gpg &gt; /dev/null

echo &quot;deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/alexp_key.gpg] https://notesalexp.org/debian/$(lsb_release -sc)/ $(lsb_release -sc) main&quot; | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/alexp.list 

sudo apt update 

sudo apt install veracrypt</description>
