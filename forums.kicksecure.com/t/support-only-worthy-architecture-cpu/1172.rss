    <title>Support Only Worthy Architecture &amp; CPU</title>

    <description>Only x86 will should be supported, due to its widespread use (Intel or AMD CPUs or so). Support may be extended in the future to other freedom (or almost freedom) based architectures, such as RISC-V.

ARM or similar proprietary architectures will not be supported—there’s no reason to waste time on them. Supporting the most common proprietary architecture (x86) is sufficient. (Though seL4&amp;Linux supports ARM anyway).</description>
