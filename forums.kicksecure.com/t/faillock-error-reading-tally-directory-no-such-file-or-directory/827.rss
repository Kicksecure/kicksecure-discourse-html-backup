    <title>Faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/faillock-error-reading-tally-directory-no-such-file-or-directory/827</link>
    <description>Woke up one morning with the laptop on my chest. To get Tor rocking I tried to set manually sdwdate clock like I always do, because the CMOS battery is done or something else is off since replacing the battery didint make any difference. 

Anyway got **ERROR: Login blocked after 50 attempts**. Followed unlocking instructions from Unlock User Account: Excessive Wrong Password Entry Attempts on Safely Use Root Commands page.

Booted in to a recovery mode in GRUB/BIOS advanced options for ... something.
Run the      **faillock --user user --reset**     in the maintenance state/mode.
Went back to regular kicksecure and sudo/login pw was still locked.
Tried several times back and forth with no avail.
Also tried only **faillock** command which should show list of login attempts.
It told me:  **faillock: Error reading tally directory: No such file or directory**
Tried  **which faillock**  it told me the path to faillock, so it seems to be existing anyway. 

To clarify I can get to desktop by turning on laptop since there is only encryption password prompt, but cant do anything sudo and if I let it idle too long the login prompt comes up and I have to reboot to get back, though I could maybe remove hibernation or whatever it is that triggers login prompt. 

Printed all that internets had about it. Havent tried other stuff yet. Many point towards creating/touching such a directory. Dont know if I should follow strangers advice to touch hidden places. What could go wrong?

Still wondering how it got locked. Is it even possible to fall a sleep with hands on keyboard on such a position that the user login prompt gets saturated? Will it accept continous enter as a attempt?</description>
