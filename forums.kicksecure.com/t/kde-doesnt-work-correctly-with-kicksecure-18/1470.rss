    <title>Kde doesn&#39;t work correctly with Kicksecure 18</title>

    <description>Hi guys, active kicksecure user since more than 2 years.
First of all thank you very much for all the job you do for support privacy, security and especially, for FOSS.

Basically my post is just for communicate and put on record in the forum, that for me, has been impossible to configure and run smoothly kde plasma 6 in kicksecure 18. I know has been some discussion about which desktop environment would be better for the security standards and that kde is not the best.
But I like it.

I have 2 pcs, 1 laptop and 1 desktop. At the moment I was using kicksecure 17 in combination with kde without major problems. I installed kicksecure, kde, removed xfce4, and all worked fine in both devices.
2 weeks ago I saw the new update to debian 13, what allowed me to use kde plasma 6, so I decided to upgrade to the new kicksecure version. In the laptop all has worked great, it’s a normal laptop without external gpu and stranger things. 
But for the desktop has been impossible to have kde and kicksecure 18 running well. I don’t know which could be the problem, maybe nvidia drivers, or some packets of kicksecure that broke the kde compositor.

I have tried to install kicksecure and later kde, install debian 13 and later kicksecure-cli version. Installing nvidia drivers, removing configurations. A lots of things. But at the moment I install kicksecure following the guide of the docs, kde stop working correctly. Problems in the compositor, win manager, crash on wayland sessions, and a fucking random orange and pink wallpaper that I don’t know where the hell it come from and I can’t remove it. XDDD 


I have been more than 1 week trying to find the origin to all of these problems, but I’m just a casual linux user so couldn’t do too much.

I know kde is not supported in kicksecure but I have been using both of them correctly for more than 2 years. Maybe, I’m not sure, some packet or configuration is breaking kde. For me I’m going to come back to kicksecure 17 for the desktop because I’m used to kde and I can’t really work well without it.

            <p>Forgive my ignorance on the subject.</p>
<p>How much hard would be to me try to contribute in this issue and how I could start to take a look? I mean, I’m software developer but I have no idea how works this world of create custom ISOs of OS so. I’m a little lost.</p>
<p>I have checked through the system check, and after make the release-upgrade a package named “kicksecure-baremetal-server” or something similar has been removed. In the moment I install It or the lxqt variation my Desktop environment stop running correctly.</p>
<p>I suppose that this package is the kicksecure’s core. What happend if I don’t have It installed? How could I debug It? Because I don’t understand why the baremetal client versión broke the Desktop environment anyway, it shouldn’t affect.</p>
<p>Sorry but I’m rucky in this subject as u can see.</p>

            <p>Unfortunately using other desktop environments has become much more difficult due to technical issues. (See: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Other_Desktop_Environments#Technical_Information">Technical Information</a> (written just now))</p>
<p>Therefore KDE (or other desktop environments) compatibility is not coming anytime soon unless contributed by a developer.</p>
