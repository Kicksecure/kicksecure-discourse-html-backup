    <title>Kicksecure distro specific keyboard shortcuts</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-distro-specific-keyboard-shortcuts/1147</link>
    <description>Well I wanted to give some feedback on accessibility/productivity via keyboard shortcuts that would be nice to have in Kicksecure. Xfce is a little different then others but I recall that the Xfce version of Manjaro had shortcuts specific to that OS even on Xfce. In fact I&#39;m more then sure there was another distro that was discontinued but specifically had keymaps set for Chromebook hardware but I don&#39;t member the name? It did however use Xfce as desktop env is what I&#39;m getting at. 

I manually created some keyboard shortcuts but these would make Kicksecure more productivity appealing.

* Whiskermenu shortcut

Super key for menu drop down &quot;Super L&quot; for fast searching

command: `xfce4-popup-whiskermenu`


* Screenshot shortcut

Set to the &quot;Print key&quot; but some layouts might be the &quot;End&quot; key

command: `xfce4-screenshooter`


* Lockscreen shortcut

&quot;Super + L&quot; just like windows has for locking your workstation when leaving your desk.

command: `xscreensaver -lock`


* Notepad shortcut

&quot;Super + N&quot; or &quot;Super + M&quot; for mousepad since its the default notepad on xfce.

command: `mousepad`


Volume controls (my hardware was not detected)

- Volume up

command: `amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%+`

- Volume down

command: `amixer -D pulse sset Master 5%-`

- Mute

command: `amixer -D pulse sset Master toggle`


Looking into how Kicksecure could set distro specific keyboard shortcuts would make it more complete since my assumption is Xfce is gonna stay. 

P.S. Is there any other DE spins going to made for future releases?</description>

            <p>I just wanted to say I like these ideas very much.<br>
The windows superkey for menu and lockscreen shortcut being the ones I like the most.</p>

<p>Ok then whisker menu will not be used. I think these shortcuts should be added to Kicksecure in the meantime via dconf which would be easier to change over from <code>xfce4-popup-whiskermenu</code> → “command to launch LXQT’s menu” when a switch over from enviroments happens.</p>
<p>The super key or “windows key” is commonly used as a shortcut to launch menu like it is on Windows taskbar.</p>

            <p>It’s unlikely that additional DE spins will be added since every desktop comes with its own unique challenges, both for development and for support. That being said, there’s a good chance we will switch desktops from Xfce to LXQt when we port to Trixie (which we’re working on), since Xfce’s Wayland support is rather lacking, LXQt’s is more mature, and switching to Wayland is a goal for Kicksecure 18.</p>
