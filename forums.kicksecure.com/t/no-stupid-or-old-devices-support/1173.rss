    <description>There shouldnt be any old or nonsense software support in the system level (like IRC in the kernel?! or Floppy Disk Support..)

If necessary, such support may be possible within the App-per-VM (ApV) model, since it&#39;s based on Linux and already includes support for these kinds of legacy features. However, this will never be a priority.</description>
