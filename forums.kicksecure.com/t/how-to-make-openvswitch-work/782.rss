    <title>How to make openvswitch work?</title>

    <description>Hi, I need to make openvswitch to work on Kicksecure! After I bridge my NIC I can&#39;t connect to internet anymore. I can&#39;t ping anything on the same subnet. I executed `arp` command and it founds every other machine on the same subnet but the hwaddress(mac address of other machine on the subnet boardcast)  are showing &quot;(incomeplete)&quot;. Please help me!</description>
