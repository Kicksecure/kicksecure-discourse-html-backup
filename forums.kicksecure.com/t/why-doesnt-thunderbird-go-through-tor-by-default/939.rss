    <title>Why doesn&#39;t Thunderbird go through Tor by default?</title>

    <description>I think Thunderbird should go through Tor just like APT. While Kicksecure and Whonix both serve different design goals/purposes, I think other applications in Kicksecure should take advantage of using Tor by default like APT already is.

These &quot;Apps&quot; should be Kicksecure specific since if the same configuration were on the same Apps on Whonix WS it would cause issues like Tor over Tor or not working etc.</description>

<p>Using Kicksecure as a Whonix-Custom-Workstation is also not a project goal.</p>
<p>Whonix-Workstation is already based on Kicksecure. So there is very limited need for making Kicksecure more similar to Whonix.</p>
