    <description>I also do have this issue even without running kicksecure fom ventoy!
I installed kicksecure onto usb flash drive following word for word the official installation tutorial to install kicksecure iso to usb flash drive. Booting after installation works, but afterwards I shutdown, unplugged the flash drive and booted the linux host on the hardware, kicksecure boots only to grub bash line.</description>

I followed your tutorial but it didn’t fix the issue <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/expressionless.png?v=12" title=":expressionless:" class="emoji" alt=":expressionless:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"><br>
I also consider something is iffy with my hardware config resp. with my UEFI setup.<br>
The entry of the (non-booting) partition 1 (= /boot/efi) is constantly ‘restored’ (or so it seems) no matter what I do (like <code>efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L 'Kicksecure' -l 'EFI\Kicksecure\shimx64.efi'</code> or installing GRUB to the fallback bootloader location on the USB drive as you explained in detail).<br>

<p><em>On the other hand I never had this hardware/ UEFI problem with any other OS installed on an usb flash drive!?</em> How can it be? And why isn’t there the same boot problem with the flash drive running LIVE Kicksecure?</p>

            <p>I just finished testing in a QEMU VM, making a setup with Linux Mint installed to a virtual internal drive, and Kicksecure installed to a virtual USB drive. Making GRUB install to the fallback bootloader location overwrote the bootloader on the USB drive, and appears to have left Mint’s bootloader intact. So I believe this works.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>GRUB would end up being installed to the fallback bootloader location <em>on the USB drive.</em> assuming that the USB drive’s EFI system partition is mounted to <code>/boot/efi</code> in the Kicksecure system. You should be able to check this using <code>lsblk</code> - boot Kicksecure, run <code>lsblk</code>, identify which drive is your Kicksecure USB drive, and then see where the partitions on it are mounted. If one of them (usually the first one) is mounted to <code>/boot/efi</code>, then it should be safe to install GRUB to the fallback bootloader location (though note I have not tested this yet - if GRUB does something really crazy and mounts some other drive’s EFI system partition to do the installation then there’s a problem, but I find it very unlikely GRUB would do that).</p>
<p>All UEFI-bootable drives have an <code>EFI</code> directory, with a number of subdirectories under it. Each subdirectory contains one or more bootloaders that a particular operating system makes use of. In addition to the per-OS bootloader directories, there’s also a fallback bootloader directory called <code>BOOT</code>. Any UEFI-bootable drive will have this structure, though sometimes one drive can have bootloaders intended to boot an OS located on a different drive.</p>
<p>Installing GRUB to the fallback location should make sure that Kicksecure’s bootloader was installed to the fallback bootloader location on the USB drive. It should not overwrite your existing bootloaders (fallback or otherwise) on your main drive. (I can test this on my end to make extra sure that nothing goes wrong.)</p>
<p>The reason the Kicksecure live USB works is because its bootloader is installed to the fallback location when the ISO is built. Because the Kicksecure ISO is “foreign” to your system, the UEFI firmware won’t know about the bootloaders installed on the ISO when you try to boot the ISO. Because of this, it will boot from the fallback location on the ISO, and because of the ISO build process that location also is the right location to boot from. This is one reason the fallback bootloader location is also known as the “removable media path”, because it’s the location the firmware generally tries to boot USBs, optical discs, and other removable media from.</p>

            <p>Thank you very much for your help. However, I have great doubts about installing Grub on the fallback location of my host system’s disk as you suggested. For one, because of possible data loss, as you warned me, but also because my host operating system works with Systemdboot and I would rather not mix Grub with Systemdboot.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This definitely sounds like a bug with your system’s firmware or maybe another operating system on your machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Are you sure of that? Shouldn’t the live Kicksecure system suffer of the same symptoms on my hardware then? And why does the installed Kicksecure usb flash drive show the same problem on another hardware?<br>
And an installation of Kicksecure on another usb flash drive ended up with the same lost entry!</p>

            <p>This definitely sounds like a bug with your system’s firmware or maybe another operating system on your machine. UEFI boot entries should not just disappear like that, they are designed to be persistent because they’re a vital part of the boot process.</p>
<p>A good workaround is for Kicksecure to always install itself to the fallback bootloader location on your disk. Sadly doing this in Kicksecure itself is going to be a bit more involved than I initially realized, and so will take some time. For the short-term however, you can get it set up yourself by doing the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <code>sudo apt install grub-efi-amd64</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo dpkg-reconfigure grub-efi-amd64</code> and accept the default settings for most of the questions you are asked.</li>
<li>When asked if you want to always install GRUB to the fallback bootloader location, answer “Yes”.</li>
</ol>
<p>That <em>should</em> get GRUB installed to the fallback location, and make it so you can boot the system using the USB drive’s boot menu entry rather than <em>having</em> to use Kicksecure’s boot menu entry that keeps vanishing. Note that if the drive where GRUB is installed has anything else at that fallback bootloader location, this <em>will</em> erase it. Currently Kicksecure only puts a not-really-useful copy of GRUB there that gives you a bootloader command line, so in this situation it probably won’t cause any harm to do this, but if you ever have Kicksecure installed alongside other operating systems, doing this could end up erasing things that you don’t want to erase. Windows in particular puts some of its boot code in the fallback location (though I don’t <em>think</em> it becomes unbootable if you overwrite that?), while Ubuntu puts some code there that finds available bootloaders and puts them back into the UEFI settings in the event something goes wrong.</p>

            <p>As partition 1 is always present in the boot menu of the usb flash drive but not the relevant bootable partition 2 ‘Kicksecure’, I deleted the entry of partition 1 with: <code>sudo efibootmgr -B -b 0008</code> and so far it seems that ‘made way’ for the entry of partition 2, which so far outlasted a reboot of another OS.

            <p>Sadly the issue reappeared after some restarts: No Partition 2 listed in the efi boot menu.<br>
So I booted with the help of SuperGrubDisk and reexecuted:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L 'Kicksecure' -l 'EFI\Kicksecure\shimx64.efi'
BootCurrent: 0009
Timeout: 0 seconds
BootOrder: 0001,0008,0009,0000,0007
Boot0000* Linux Boot Manager
Boot0007* UEFI OS
Boot0008* UEFI:  USB, Partition 1
Boot0009* UEFI: Intenso, Partition 2
Boot0001* Kicksecure
</code></pre>
<p>That “fixed” it for the time being. But I suppose that the boot entry will disappear again in a little while.<br>
<a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> I didn’t keep the installation log -pity! I intend to install Kicksecure on an USB flash drive tomorrow once again just for the sake of getting that log for you.</p>

            <p>It could very well be an EFI BIOS bug, as the entry is picked up properly when I do an install into a UEFI-enabled virtual machine here. But yes, the installer log would be helpful if it still exists.</p>

<p>Since that seems to have fixed it, it seems calamares is not executing that command or something going wrong during it?</p>
<p>So we’d need the calamares installer log, see what’s happening there, then compare with this command?</p>
<p>Any chance you could provide (that part) of the calamares installer log? <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/kinoe">@kinoe</a></p>

            <p>Ah, ok. I thought the entry was missing from the GRUB boot menu, which is how I got confused.</p>
<p>I think I can reproduce your issue here. Somehow your UEFI firmware isn’t picking up a Kicksecure boot entry, meaning the only option you have in your list is just the USB drive’s boot entry. Booting from that results in Kicksecure’s fallback bootloader being invoked, and due to a bug in Kicksecure this simply drops you to a GRUB shell.</p>
<p>To fix the problem, you should be able to use efibootmgr within Kicksecure to add a Kicksecure boot entry to the list that will work properly. Based on the screenshots you’ve sent, the proper command to do this <em>should</em> be:</p>
<pre><code>sudo efibootmgr -c -d /dev/sda -p 1 -L 'Kicksecure' -l 'EFI\Kicksecure\shimx64.efi'
</code></pre>
<p>The other bug (where the fallback bootloader doesn’t work) needs to be solved and is something I’ll likely be looking into in the near future.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer. I’m <strong>not</strong> <em>dual-booting</em> Kicksecure, rather installed it on usb flash drive.<br>
I tried to boot it on a host system which uses itself Grub2 and on another which boots by systemdboot. On both Laptops the boot partition of Kicksecure is only detected as long as the host system has not been booted!</p>
<p>And here’s the partition table of the flash drive as gparted displays it:<br>

            <p>The GRUB “errors” aren’t really issues, GRUB is looking for files that are sometimes present on ISO files that aren’t present on your particular ISO file (the Super Grub Disk one).</p>
<p>Kicksecure boots by UUIDs in the GRUB config file.</p>
<p>To be clear, are you <em>dual-booting</em> Kicksecure alongside another Linux distro? If so, you probably need to enable <code>os-prober</code> on your primary distro. To do that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>sudo nano /etc/default/grub</code> on the main OS, then find the line that looks like <code>#GRUB_DISABLE_OS_PROBER=false</code> and uncomment it by removing the <code>#</code> from the start. Then press <kbd>Ctrl+S</kbd> to save, then <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to exit. (It’s possible that you’ll find that this line is already uncommented, in which case you can just close the file and proceed to the next step.)</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo update-grub</code> to regenerate the GRUB menu.</li>
<li>On your next reboot you should see an entry for Kicksecure in the boot menu. Boot into Kicksecure and repeat this process there so that in the event Kicksecure’s GRUB takes over, you can still see and boot your main OS.</li>

            <p>I really don’t know what is going on here: After booting Kicksecure several times with the aid of Super Grub Disk, an entry for Kicksecure showed up in the Grub menu, meaning Partition 2 (hd0, gpt2) is detected! But after running the host OS, the entry to Kicksecure is gone again, whats left is: <em>UEFI: USB, Partition 1</em> thats leading to the Grub cmd line only.</p>
<p>EDIT: Tried booting on another Laptop ends up with the same result: No entry for Partition 2 and choosing Partition 1 ends with Grub cmd line</p>
<p>EDIT2: During boot resp. boot attempt of Kicksecure (with Super Grub Disk resp. without it) shows an error for a split second:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">error: no such device: /.disk/info.
error: no such device: /.disk/mini-info.
</code></pre>
<p>Don’t know if thats relevant</p>
<p>Does Kicksecure (configure Grub2 to) boot by uuid or by labels? In fstab its uuid.</p>

            <p>Thanks for taking an interest.<br>
-I followed the instructions here: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Live_Mode#Boot_standard_-_live_mode_or_persistent_mode" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Live Mode for Kicksecure</a><br>
-Version: Kicksecure-Xfce-17.2.3.7.iso copied to flash drive by balenaEtcher<br>
-Booted and installed to another 64GB USB flash drive with luks encryption<br>
-Booted that new installed Kicksecure 64GB USB flash drive, installed Whonix and shut down - so far so good<br>
But after running the host system (Arch Linux) once, without flash drive plugged in, the replugged Kicksecure flash drive merely boots to Grub bash line!<br>
I managed to boot it by the help of Super-Grub2-disk, which finds the Grub entry and boots from it.<br>
Journalctl is reporting a Swap File Creator error but I’m not sure its relevant.<br>
In Kicksecure again I did as follows:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">sudo apt-get full-upgrade
sudo apt-get full-upgrade --target-release=bookworm-fasttrack
whonix-xfce-installer-cli
</code></pre>
<p>and to fix the boot issue I kinda fiddled around, maybe made it worse:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">dpkg-query -W -f='${db:Status-Status}' dracut '=&gt; installed
dpkg-query -W -f='${db:Status-Status}' initramfs-tools ' =&gt; not-installed
sudo apt install --reinstall dracut grub-live
sudo dracut --hostonly --force
sudo update-grub =&gt; no errors
</code></pre>
<p>Here is the /etc/default/grub:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">GRUB_DEFAULT=0
GRUB_TIMEOUT=5
GRUB_DISTRIBUTOR='Kicksecure'
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT='quiet rd.luks.uuid=82fbd4c5-b874-4c81-9a30-7aad4eb2aee4'
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=""
</code></pre>
