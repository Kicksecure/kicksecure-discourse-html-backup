    <title>Getting some strange errors in Whonix on a new PC</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/getting-some-strange-errors-in-whonix-on-a-new-pc/748</link>
    <description>I&#39;ve been using Whonix which is based on Kicksecure for many years but I just got a new PC and now I&#39;m having problems booting it in VirtualBox. I tried posting this on the Whonix forums but they suggested I ask here.

Sometimes it will boot correctly and sometimes it will get stuck. I&#39;m often seeing strange errors/warnings around where it gets stuck which could be related. Unfortunately this forum won&#39;t allow me to post a link or upload an image.

The errors seem to refer to the CPU so it might be worth mentioning I have an AMD Ryzen 7 9800x3d which has only just come out recently. Is there a known issue with this CPU?</description>

            <p>When you said Whonix is based on Kicksecure I assumed you were implying that this isn’t a Whonix issue so I posted the same question here.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter anyway since this isnt a Whonix or Kicksecure problem. It’s a long-standing problem with VirtualBox and AMD processors. As I said in my other thread on the Whonix forums, the workaround is to set the number of CPUs/cores to 1 in VirtualBox.</p>

<p>I did not say that. I just said:</p>

<p>(Whonix is based on Kicksecure.)</p>

<p>Which is true. Which means, the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/VirtualBox/Troubleshooting" class="inline-onebox">Kicksecure ™ in VirtualBox - Troubleshooting - Kicksecure ™ does not Start?</a> URL links to the Kicksecure website but the documentation to be found there in this case is also applicable to Whonix.</p>
