            <p>The GRUB boot menu isn’t directly related which limited non-administrative account (not <code>sysmaint</code> account) will login.</p>
<p>By Kicksecue default, in user session, autologin is enabled for account <code>user</code>. This is probably causing confusion for multi-user use cases.</p>
<p>Additional confusion might be caused by calling a boot session “<code>user session</code>”, which does not refer to Linux login account user “<code>user</code>”.</p>
<p>By disabling autologin a lot confusion will be reduced. Because then the usual GUI or CLI login prompts can be used.</p>
<p>Related user documentation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/User" class="inline-onebox">User Management</a> wiki page chapter <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/User#Add_a_New_User">Add a New User</a>.
<ul>
<li>(And maybe related chapters such as <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/User#Allow_New_User_to_Login_to_Virtual_Console">Allow New User to Login to Virtual Console</a>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Also <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Login" class="inline-onebox">Login Security</a> wiki page chapter <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Login#Configuring_GUI_Autologin">Configuring GUI Autologin</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Multi-user - in this context - multiple humans sharing the same operating system on the same computer and using different user accounts for login is probably pretty unpopular for end-users. I think I might have seen some data if this in the past.</p>
<p>Maybe still somewhat popular in some corporate contexts.</p>
<p>So this currently isn’t tested much and isn’t a priority for Kicksecure at the time of writing. At the time when terminology was coined and the word “<code>user session</code>” introduced, perhaps there would have been a better wording that doesn’t confuse it with “account <code>user</code>”.</p>
<p>That is why a feature to choose which Linux user account to login with at GRUB boot will very most likely not be implemented. It would also technically be challanging and make our already demanding (on usability and development effort) GRUB boot menu even more demanding.</p>
