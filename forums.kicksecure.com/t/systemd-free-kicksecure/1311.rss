    <description>Hi, this is my first post here,

I really love Kicksecure and Whonix, so thank you to all for providing this. 

I was thinking of distromorphing kicksecure for a metal install and wanted to avoid systemd. As many researchers agree that it can be a  security issue.


Would it be possible to distromorph from Devuan? 
How many packages would need to be changed that rely on systemd?

Thanks</description>
