    <title>Wrong FDE password 3 times - System Halted</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/wrong-fde-password-3-times-system-halted/1143</link>
    <description>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:

dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory

reboot: system halted

From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</description>

            <p>Just a simple mistake. I’ve also managed to mistype my password 3 times in a row occasionally.</p>

<p>No need at all. Just reboot and continue normally.</p>

            <p>This is probably fine. If you type the wrong LUKS password three times, the part of the boot process that unlocks the disk will fail. This will in turn cause the boot process to hang for a while waiting for the root device to show up (which will never happen due to the unlock failure), then finally the mount attempt will fail and Dracut will fall back to emergency mode. Kicksecure is designed to deny access to an emergency mode shell (via kernel parameter <code>rd.emergency=halt</code>), so it will simply halt the system instead (resulting in the “system halted” message you saw). It is normal to be unable to type anything during early boot except when you are explicitly asked for the LUKS passphrase.</p>
