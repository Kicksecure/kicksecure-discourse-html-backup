    <title>Wrong FDE password 3 times - System Halted</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/wrong-fde-password-3-times-system-halted/1143</link>
    <description>Hello! So, as the title suggests, i acidenally typed the wrong password 3 times (FDE Password) and then the system started spitting this out after a bit of waiting:

dracut-initiqueue [6234]: failed to connect to bus: no such file or directory

reboot: system halted

From this moment on, my keyboard was not owrking and i could not type anything, so after waiting for 2 or so minutes, i held down the power button on my pc and it shut down. Then i re-did the process (Got the password right this time)
Could something have gone wrong? Should i re-install just to be safe or is my system fine as is?</description>

<p>Yeah but if your using Coreboot <em>someone correct me</em> there is a module in UEFI it detects the LUKS-encrypted disk and prompts the user for the password during the firmware phase.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what it is exactly but on systems I have installed LUKS on, which the computer was not corebooted, it typically will take you to the grub menu before prompting for LUKS. As compared to Coreboot it will prompt for the LUKS password in the BIOS screen before even being able to get to GRUB menu.</p>
<p>It doesn’t allow you to see what your typing in Coreboot.<br>
But this is separate to Plymouth but I thought I read somewhere that Plymouth was removed due to another issue?</p>

<p>Your fine as long as you verified the sha256sum of the ISO and verified it with Kicksecures GPG key. I have entered my password wrong plenty of times due to creating long passwords for LUKS so thing hits home with me.</p>

<p>Admittedly I’m using Kicksecure in Qubes OS, so I do not know if this is already a thing. But perhaps it would be a good idea to include a Plymouth theme that lets you show the characters that you type like in Qubes OS.</p>
<p>Before Qubes OS 4.2, it did not include this and I made a mistake 3x in a row occasionally too.</p>

<p>No need at all. Just reboot and continue normally.</p>

            <p>This is probably fine. If you type the wrong LUKS password three times, the part of the boot process that unlocks the disk will fail. This will in turn cause the boot process to hang for a while waiting for the root device to show up (which will never happen due to the unlock failure), then finally the mount attempt will fail and Dracut will fall back to emergency mode. Kicksecure is designed to deny access to an emergency mode shell (via kernel parameter <code>rd.emergency=halt</code>), so it will simply halt the system instead (resulting in the “system halted” message you saw). It is normal to be unable to type anything during early boot except when you are explicitly asked for the LUKS passphrase.</p>
