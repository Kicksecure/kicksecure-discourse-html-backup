    <title>How to delete command line history?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/how-to-delete-command-line-history/941</link>
    <description>Hi All, I&#39;m new here and still learning Kicksecure. On other Linux distros, if I want to delete my command line history, I can use `history -c &amp;&amp; history -w`. These command options seem to be missing from Kicksecure. What is the Kickescure way to do this? If anyone has a link about how Kicksecure handles the history command, I would be happy to read it. There are probably security and privacy concerns around the history command, so I could see why Kicksecure wouldn&#39;t use the Linux defaults for it. Any help is greatly appreciated!</description>

            <p>The relevant difference is, that Kicksecure uses <code>zsh</code> by default. (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Shell#Default_Interactive_Shell">Default Interactive Shell</a>)</p>
<p>Hence, documentation corresponding for <code>zsh</code> should be fuctional.</p>
