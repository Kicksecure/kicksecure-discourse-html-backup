    <title>KS/Whonix on MicroSD?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/ks-whonix-on-microsd/1463</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Ok, so I’m a TAILS OS user from wayback, but, as you all know, its not the most convenient ‘daily driver’ option, hence, I like the idea of KS/Whonix on a persistent USB.

To that end, has anyone manged to clone this configuration to a MicroSD card?

I have my ‘persistent’ TAILS OS on a 32GB MicroSD, which makes portable concealment that much easier.

Cheers.</description>

            <p>Correct!</p>
<p>Initially I cloned from 32GB USB to 64GB USB drive’s and it worked, no issues.</p>
<p>I then tried from the 64GB USB to a 32GB MicroSD and it failed with ~“insufficient memory” as the error message.</p>
<p>So, off the the store for me.</p>
<p>Still very hopeful though.</p>

            <p>Is the SD card <em>bigger</em> than the USB drive? If so, it should just work. (Growing the root partition could be challenging, I’m not sure we have that documented anywhere, but even without growing the partition, the system should work.) Of course, if the card is smaller, then there are problems. Generally it’s a good idea to clone from a smaller drive to a bigger drive rather than cloning between two drives of the same size, since two drives that claim to be the same size (32 GB for instance) might be slightly different sizes “under the hood”, which can give you the same complications as cloning to a too-small drive.</p>

            <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>So far so good. I am using Linux dd to ‘clone’ the USB to a MicroSD card and, apart from a device size mismatch(my bad), its looking good.</p>
<p>I can boot my MicroSD TAILS OS from the grub boot menu whilst its in the SD slot or when mounted in a USB-A/C adaptor, but they are different from the Kicksecure boot method, so it remains to be seen if it works.</p>
<p>But, I’ll report back when I have purchased a matching size MicroSD.</p>
<p>I’m very hopeful.</p>

            <p>I have not personally tried this (systems that are able to boot from an SD card slot are rather rare in my experience), but I see no reason why it shouldn’t work. As long as your system’s firmware can access the SD card at boot time, you should be able to just install Kicksecure onto it like you’d <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/USB_Installation">install it persistently on a USB drive</a>, and then use it. Linux sees SD cards as block device just like USB drives and internal drives, so there should be no issues there.</p>
