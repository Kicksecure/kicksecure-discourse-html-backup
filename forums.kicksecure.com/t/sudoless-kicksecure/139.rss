    <description>Can you point out the reasons sudo is currently needed?  For instance, links to kicksecure github sources that depend on it?  I am interested in sudoless (and completely passwordless, except for encryption) for single-user workstations, but need to have some idea what I&#39;d be up against if I tried to get that with kicksecure.</description>

<p>That must be by accident. At time of writing, there’s no extensive changes to recovery mode by Kicksecure.</p>
<p>In my experience, recovery mode is non-networked by default. Kicksecure didn’t change this. Might be dependent on the Linux distribution, default desktop environment and there packages they pull.</p>

</aside>
<p>Is it possible that installing Kicksecure disables this?  I have 3 Debian bullseye VMs, and the 2 that don’t (yet) have Kicksecure have networking in recovery mode - specifically, the ifup@ens3.service is active.  And apt update works.  But the VM with Kicksecure does not have networking by default in recovery mode.  Was that done intentionally or by accident?</p>
<p>The easy way to fix it is to add a networking service wants link for the rescue target:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/rescue.target.wants
ln -s /lib/systemd/system/networking.service /etc/systemd/system/rescue.target.wants/

<p>I am considering going sudo-less with root account locked, and I don’t know how much of kicksecure I can incorporate into that.  This openvt suid code is probably how I will proceed, as I now consider it a better alternative than rescue mode, as I can use it during normal operation without rebooting.  My point to posting it is to show that rescue mode does not need to be the only way to do root tasks when going sudo-less with root locked.  If relying on an unproven rescue mode was the original reason for the reluctance to do a sudo-less Kicksecure.</p>

            <p>Back on topic: Sudoless Kicksecure.  Addressing the issue about how robust the rescue boot forcing root logins is by having an alternative way to get to root that is just as secure as a rescue boot, and more secure than sudo, su, polkit, etc. as those are all susceptible to programmatic attacks by malicious software, and to misconfiguration errors.<br>
Below is a very small C program for a suid exe that will open a root console and switch back when the console exits.  This is a secure way to get to root during a normally booted (non-rescue) X or console session, and works even if the root account is locked.  I have tested that it works, and it seems secure on my own judgement, but would appreciate other opinions.  Obviously, if on a multi-user system use file permissions to only allow execution by users who can be trusted with root capabilities.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

#define OPENVT "/usr/bin/openvt"

/* Establish a very basic and safe environment for the VT session.  Note:
 * if we don't set SHELL, then a very simple attack would be to set SHELL
 * to a malicious exe and run this suid, with the result that the malicious
 * exe would get root privileges. */
char *vtenv[] = {
	"PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin",
	"SHELL=/usr/bin/bash",
	"TERM=linux",
	"LOGNAME=root",
	"HOME=/root",
	"USER=root",
	NULL};

int main() {
	/* really become root: */
	setreuid(0, 0);
	setregid(0, 0);
	/* null-out stdin,stdout,stderr to prevent redirect-IO attacks: */
	int nullfp = open("/dev/null", O_RDWR);
	dup2(nullfp, 0);
	dup2(nullfp, 1);
	dup2(nullfp, 2);
	/* openvt options used:
	 * -l makes it a login session by prefixing the shell with '-'
	 * -s switches to the VT
	 * -w waits for exit from the VT and switches back
	 * The problem with using -e /usr/bin/bash instead of setting SHELL to /usr/bin/bash
	 * is that -e interferes with -w.
	 * */
	execle(OPENVT,OPENVT,"-lsw",NULL,vtenv);
	return 0;

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>It’s not worth pursuing unless there is considerable interest in going sudoless with no root logins allowed (except rescue boots).  I’m new here, so I don’t have any idea how much interest there is on this.  As an alternative, I noticed that kicksecure puts in protections against brute-forcing passwords.  But is there anything kicksecure adds that prevents X key loggers?  I don’t know of any such tech short of using wayland with xwayland disabled.  But, IMHO wayland environments don’t (yet) provide the stability of X running some tried-and-true window manager.  So, if using X, going passwordless is a better way to prevent password attacks.</p>

  <p>Hello both and thanks for your kind replies. Apologies for the late answer but I have been kind of busy today.  Well, I tried to install security-misc on a private relay I am running for testing purposes. After the reboot when I tried to become root...</p>

which implies that sudo is there as a way to make sure that the installation of kicksecure doesn’t result in admin lockout.  That’s a good reason.  However, it implies that maybe sudo isn’t needed after installation.<br>
Unfortunately, there are many other uses of sudo in the sources.  It isn’t clear to me whether they are for convenience purposes or required.</p>
<p>As for requiring sudo to prevent admin lockout during install: another way would be to make sure that root logins in rescue mode always happen, even if root is otherwise locked.  This can be done with a single dropin file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/rescue.service.d
cat &gt;/etc/systemd/system/rescue.service.d/force-root.conf &lt;&lt;EOF
[Service]
Environment=SYSTEMD_SULOGIN_FORCE=yes
EOF
</code></pre>
<p>Then require that the rest of the install of kicksecure be done in rescue mode (probably safer anyway).</p>
<p>Also, on the topic of sudo: has anyone doing kicksecure devo thought about a lighter weight and potentially more secure alternative, like siduction’s doas command?  Personally, I’d like to do away with any way to change from one user to another (or root), but I understand that’s not a universal taste.</p>

            <p>Can you point out the reasons sudo is currently needed?  For instance, links to kicksecure github sources that depend on it?  I am interested in sudoless (and completely passwordless, except for encryption) for single-user workstations, but need to have some idea what I’d be up against if I tried to get that with kicksecure.</p>
