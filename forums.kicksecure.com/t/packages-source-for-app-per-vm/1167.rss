    <description>Note: This is written with the assumption of having a separation between the packages for the system differ from the packages for ApV.

Hosting our own packages on our own servers would be the ideal solution, and that’s true. However, with a small team and limited resources, that’s not currently feasible (though it should remains the long-term goal).

What we can do instead is source packages from existing systems, whether Nix, Arch, Gentoo, or others as long as we can obtain pure, upstream, patchless packages. Reproducibility is essential here to ensure that the packages have not been tampered with in the path of delivery.

- FSDG Consideration: This all can go through only supporting freedom software (software for the ApV must be taken from FSDG distro repository in this case).
- Upstream package purity discussion can be found [here](https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/secure-and-trustless-trust-minimal-package-policy/1157). 
- Keep always things updated can be found [here](https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/rolling-vs-stable-release-brainstorming/1139).</description>

            <p>What gets me about Android is how they do per-user storage, not global. I wish Debian’s APT did this but its limited due to the nature of its design.</p>
<p>I tried installing a <code>.deb</code> package locally with dpkg but it will always be system-wide unavoidly.</p>
