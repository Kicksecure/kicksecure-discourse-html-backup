  <pre><code class="Markdown">TPM provides zero practical security
====================================

TPM (Trusted Platform Module) is as useful for preventing real attackers as the TSA is at preventing real terrorists. The architecture is fundamentally flawed and most existing implementations are completely broken. I thought this argument was settled decades ago[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Computing#Criticism) when "trusted computing" was introduced mostly as a way to provide DRM and ownership capabilities to organizations. It has largely failed to impact the consumer market when it was introduced back in the early 2000s. However, recently there seems to be a movement by certain parties to reintroduce this failed product back to the market. Microsoft argues that in order to use Windows 11, you need TPM 2.0 compatible hardware because[[2]](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/08/27/update-on-windows-11-minimum-system-requirements-and-the-pc-health-check-app/):

&gt; The Trusted Platform Module(TPM) requirement enables Windows 11 to be a true Passwordless operating system, addressing phishing and other password-based attacks that are easier for attackers to execute when the TPM is not present.

Google is trying to force the ideas of "trusted computing" to web browsers[[3]](https://github.com/RupertBenWiser/Web-Environment-Integrity/blob/main/explainer.md) which although does not mention TPM explicitly, describes a design that would fit well into it.

Even Canonical is jumping on the bandwagon by bringing TPM based full-disk-encryption to Ubuntu[[4]](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tpm-backed-full-disk-encryption-is-coming-to-ubuntu) and claims it "eliminates the need for users to manually enter passphrases during boot" which is vacuously true (you also don't need to enter a passphrase if you disable it altogether but that doesn't mean it's any secure) and "eliminate the attacker’s ability to perform offline brute-force attacks against the passphrase" which is just plain false (you can brute force at a much slower speed).</code></pre>

<p>That comment makes seems helpful. If TPM was integrated inside the CPU, it would be mentioned in the specification of the CPU.</p>
<p>Maybe better with AMD fTPM and Intel PTT (Platform Trust Technology).</p>

<p>FDE cannot “easily” be done post-installation on Debian.<br>
(And probably not in anyother Open Source Linux desktop distribution either. I researched that recently and haven’t found much.)<br>
It’s called “in-place encryption”. Available for Windows. Unfortunately, for Linux  Open Source desktop there isn’t and CLI available let alone GUI.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s so difficult, it would take me a few hours. So for users this is pretty much impossible.</p>

<p>“Some other distribution is doing that” is also an insufficient rationale. As distribution developer I need to decide based on actual technical considerations. If some distribution adds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Dash">spyware</a>, Kicksecure won’t do the same. If some distribution add convenience features that significantly worsens user security, Kicksecure won’t do that either.</p>
<p>That’s why derivatives exist. Because these have different goals and make different decisions than major or other distributions.</p>

<p>Is it some some hypothetical consideration:<br>
user sees Ubuntu supports TPM → user vaguely thinking “TPM security something” → user uses Ubuntu instead of Kicksecure → loss for Kicksecure?</p>
<p>No, I doubt that is how marketing works. There’s a huge list of <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/#security">Kicksecure security features</a>. If that doesn’t convince the user, nothing will. I doubt adding “TPM encryption” (whatever the implementation) will make a difference.</p>
<p>Users instead resort to other criteria on how to decide which distribution to use.   (Supposedly) expert opinions, other authorities (media), visual design of website or software as an expression of professionalism, reddit, size of distribution, whatnot.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose calamares did support TPM transparent encryption by default… Then Kicksecure might even disable the feature by default.</p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Relying solely on TPM with a PIN or password is not the same as deriving a cryptographic key from both the password and the TPM. If the TPM is compromised - through physical tampering - the encryption is broken, even if the password is strong. This creates a single point of failure, allowing attackers to bypass password protections entirely once the TPM is compromised. Users of FDE Password + USB Keyfile benefit from enhanced security because the complete key is genuinely derived from both the user-provided password and the USB keyfile. This means that both components are required for decryption, adding significant entropy and making it much harder for an attacker to compromise the system. Unlike setups relying solely on TPM, this approach eliminates a single point of failure, requiring an attacker to break both the password and the physical key, which provides more robust protection.</p>

<p>Just because it’s going to have TPM support doesn’t mean it will be bloated; that’s a wrong assumption to begin with. We can also remove FDE support in this case (which can be done post-installation), and we call that keep it minimal. So, ‘minimal’ is undefined, and TPM is default in almost all main distro installers, whether Debian, Qubes, openSUSE…etc. It’s not like we’re doing the unusual.</p>

<p>Why TPM is important:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html" class="inline-onebox">Anti Evil Maid | The Invisible Things Blog</a></p>
<p>Good point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use custom TPM SRK password (so, you did <em>not</em> pass -z to tpm_takeownership), then you can install Anti Evil Maid onto your regular boot partition.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are many very different ways to use a TPM. While a TPM has much less features than a CPU, a general feature request “use the TPM” is as useful as “make us of the CPU”. These topics should not be mixed.</p>
<p>This is mostly in a completely different context for TPM usage. Boot security / firmware security that utilizes TPM for messurements fortunately is unrelated to calamares. To accomplish <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Measured_boot">measured boot</a>, anti evil maid, fortunately no code in any Linux installer is required. This is based on boot firmware and operating system support.</p>
<p>Using a boot firmware and operating system that supports pressured boot, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> which makes use of the TPM, might increase security. Using a TPM for transparent encryption however is completely different, optional feature, decision.</p>
<p>There is no general “use the TPM” feature which calamares could (or should) implement. Instead, very specific proposals on how to utilize the TPM could be written by developers for the purpose of increasesd security. Such features then, don’t necessarily (and hopefully) don’t need to be implemented at the calamares level, which I would hope to stay minimal.</p>
<p>A useful <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/image_formats#Goals">Goals</a> I support is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The differences in the code base for Live Systems vs. Installer Systems vs. Installed Systems should be reduced as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I want to provide a generic image for users to download. The image should be able to be flashed on an internal hard drive, a USB drive, on a server or anywhere else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then calamares would not even be required anymore. It’s a lot of engineering work ahead to get there and it’s not even clear if this can or will ever happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Installer specific code should be as minimal as possible.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Good point to why use USB to unlock your PC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti Evil Maid on a separate USB stick rather than on your built-in disk boot partition. This is because you can use Anti Evil Maid as a provider of a keyfile to your LUKS disk encryption (as an additional file unsealable by the TPM). This way you could also stop adversary that is able to sniff your keystrokes (e.g. using hidden camera, or electromagnetic leak), and capture your disk decryption passphrase (see the discussion in the next section).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Protection from an adversary that is sniffing full disk encryption passwords using cameras, doesn’t need require a TPM. Protection from that requires only an additional keyfile on USB. Keyfiles predate TPM.</p>
<p>It however doesn’t protect from an adversary that can sniff the full disk encryption password and steal the USB device including the keyfile. But a TPM won’t either.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any Linux installer that allows setting up password + keyfile on USB + backup keyfile on another USB. I would hope that there is no need to re-invent such a feature for every Linux installer and that this could instead abstracted into a general project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that usability using cryptsetup, setting up keyfiles on USB is currently very bad. It is possible to do this manually but very difficult for users. I don’t know any Linux distribution solving that. But then again, there is no magic answer. And this problem also cannot be solved by saying “use the TPM (in calamare or anywhere)”.</p>
<p>Password + keyfile on USB would indeed protect against camera password sniffing + stealing of a powered off notebook.</p>
<p>However, that calamares TPM ticket <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2355" class="inline-onebox">TPM Encryption support · Issue #2355 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a> does not suggest that. It only suggests adding <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Transparent_Encryption">TPM Transparent Encryption</a> support. This is a security reduction. It is vulnerable to a new class of attacks: warm cold boot attacks. (As described in the wiki.) (Not to be confused with the “classic”, “normal” cold boot attacks.)</p>
<p>This is also the way which the Ubuntu installer allegedly can use the TPM for.</p>
<p>As the developer in that ticket pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case an explanation of what the feature is, what it does, how it is used in Ubuntus, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make good use of a TPM for full disk encryption, it is important define adversary capabilities, the threat model. Added some of that here just now:<br>
<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Full_Disk_Encryption_Threat_Modeling">TPM Full Disk Encryption Threat Modeling</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As for using USB to unlock full disk encryption at boot that is great. (And no TPM required.)</p>
<p>But then is the question, use password + USB (more secure) or use USB only (less secure, more convenient)?</p>
<p>If that is a feature request, please open a separate forum thread for that.</p>

            <p>It’s super easy to expose BTRFS as an option in the installer. Lubuntu and Kubuntu have both been shipping with ext4, BTRFS, and XFS all available as options on the “Partitions” screen, no need for manual partitioning. It only requires tweaking one configuration file (IIRC) to make Kicksecure do the same thing.</p>

<p>TPM seems to be on the good luck road.</p>

<p>Did you ever use LVM or are you theorizing? Did you accept my challenge:</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>LVM is the default installation by qubes because it uses anaconda, and debian because it uses d-i (which i use both).</p>
<p>The challenge which you are proposing is a specific use case which i described above for ubiquity bugs, it doesnt provide any critical bug which LVM suffer VS no LVM.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If you cannot pass the challenge, you’re not really using LVM except for some transparent use in Qubes but no real user interaction.</p>
<p>Why argue for a feature which you’re actively making use yourself? Feature completeness?</p>
<p>No, feature completeness based on theoretic considerations is an insufficient argument.</p>
<p>The Linux boot process is complicated enough. (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/image_creation" class="inline-onebox">Development of System Image Creation and Bootstrapping Tools</a>)</p>
<p>Stacking another layer of complexity (LVM) without strong rationale is only making a bigger mess on top the existing usability mess. That’s why I even created <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Broken_Boot" class="inline-onebox">Broken Boot - Kicksecure</a>. Once the boot process is broken, analysis and recovery without re-installation is extremely complicated. The internet is full of of support requests by users which went unresolved.</p>
<p>I think the issue is, that we don’t have a feature request template for Kicksecure yet. This is what Qubes has:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The problem you’re addressing (if any)</li>
<li>The solution you’d like</li>
<li>The value to a user, and who that user might be</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And this is from systemd:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I’m always frustrated when […]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe the solution you’d like
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Describe alternatives you’ve considered
<ul>
<li>A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you’ve considered.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Please fill this out, describe the feature you’re <strong>personally</strong> missing.</p>
<p>Because then maybe way to get this feature is indeed LVM but perhaps there are more suitable, simpler alternatives such as btrfs</p>
<p>It might make sense to request features that one doesn’t personally need but thinks this would be good for the overall health of the project since others those need it don’t even make a feature request. But in case of LVM, I don’t think that makes sense.</p>

<p>If it was generic use issue, many would have fallen under the same condition, including marmarek himself. Probably its just unman specific config issue.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>If even unman runs into this issue, doesn’t know how to fix it and nobody knows it either, then it’s simply too difficult.</p>
<p>Or take <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/8707" class="inline-onebox">Unable to boot | "qubes_dom0-root does not exist" | Possible LVM problem · Issue #8707 · QubesOS/qubes-issues · GitHub</a>. After complex analysis, it just stalled. DemiMarie (Qubes developer) didn’t answer anymore for some reason. That could be running out of ideas or time or something else. But the reasons are speculation since the end result is the same. It’s too complex, requires too much effort to debug.</p>
<p>Since in case of Kicksecure it’s optional and doesn’t have a strong rationale, it’s best avoided.</p>
<p>That’s not the kind of reliability, stability and maintainability that I set as project goals. Related:</p>

<p>For context, I am an Ubuntu Developer, <a href="https://launchpad.net/~arraybolt3" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Aaron Rainbolt in Launchpad</a></p>
<p>Originally Ubiquity was replaced in Ubuntu Desktop with a Flutter-based installer. That installer was later converted into a more flexible “provisioning” system, the details of which can be found at <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/from-installation-to-provisioning-upgrading-the-ubuntu-desktop-installer/42139" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">From installation to provisioning - upgrading the Ubuntu Desktop installer - Desktop - Ubuntu Community Hub</a>, That system is ubuntu-desktop-provision.</p>
<p>Ubiquity was nearly removed from the Ubuntu archives entirely in the 24.04 cycle, but was kept around because it is still used in some edge cases. <a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/request-to-not-remove-ubiquity-from-24-04/42882" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Request to not remove Ubiquity from 24.04 - Desktop - Ubuntu Community Hub</a></p>
<p>The Git repo you link to with a commit 5 days ago is for Subiquity, which is a distinct and separate project from Ubiquity. It is used as the backend for ubuntu-desktop-provision and the Ubuntu Server installer.</p>

<p>LVM is the default installation by qubes because it uses anaconda, and debian because it uses d-i (which i use both).</p>
<p>The challenge which you are proposing is a specific use case which i described above for ubiquity bugs, it doesnt provide any critical bug which LVM suffer VS no LVM.</p>

<p>For example this bug bug where the system simply stops booting looks very scary: <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7877">Boot fails at “lvm event activation” · Issue #7877 · QubesOS/qubes-issues · GitHub </a></p>

<p>Checking at what he said:</p>

<p>After succesful dom0 update , but before reboot, Qubes crashed while starting a new qube.<br>
System not under load, and temperature not excessive.</p>
<p>On starting again, boot fails, sitting at “lvm event activation”.</p>

<p>We cant just point out that this is crushed and not booting because oh there is LVM mentioned on the screen, real cause need to be identified then decided if its really LVM specific or not.</p>
<p>If it was generic use issue, many would have fallen under the same condition, including marmarek himself. Probably its just unman specific config issue.</p>

<p>Its just feature less installer compared to upstream debian, regardless of what TPM provide or use case going to be for the end user.</p>
<p>If user is trusting TPM or lets say there is (theoretically) going to be open source TPM provider or so, calamares is on a lack road to support this.</p>

<p>mockresolver.c is just an optional for testing purposes tool as described. In simple comparison if someone want to get rid of every C possible in the installer, it will be easier for sure for ubiquity but not calamares.</p>

<p>Yeah it is a privacy thing, but not too much of a crazy collection because it give the option to disable it and it also anonymize the “partition method”:</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Im not sure how did you come to this conclusion, ubuntu-desktop-provision is for post installation stuff, ubiquity is the one handling partitioning and initial setup (system installer) of ubuntu (or any distro using it).</p>
<p>ubuntu-desktop-provision: For configuring an OEM provisioning flow for Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS, where user creation and account setup is handled seperately to system setup (<a href="https://github.com/canonical/ubuntu-desktop-provision?tab=readme-ov-file#24041-oem-provisioning">reference</a>).</p>
<p>Ubiquity just has a <a href="https://github.com/canonical/subiquity">new commit</a> 5 days ago.</p>
<p>Unless there is a genuine referral for ubiquity deprecation, ubiquity still the used system installer.</p>

<li>Artix Linux = True, but dont forget that upstream archlinux doesnt has a GUI installer to begin with, so its like nothing or calamares then ok calamares.</li>
<li>Ubuntu Studio = Ubiquity + Ubuntu-desktop-provision (which will just give you the opportunity to add your own packages config in yaml file, similar to nixos .config declarative file).</li>
</ul>
<p>and i know couple more as well, but tbh to my knowledge the full independent not a fork distros are lower than 5 distros like NixOS and similar.</p>

</aside>
<p>It’s not about the number of bugs (quantity). It’s about the “quality” (severity, complexity, impact) of the bugs. For example this bug bug where the system simply stops booting looks very scary: <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/7877" class="inline-onebox">Boot fails at "lvm event activation" · Issue #7877 · QubesOS/qubes-issues · GitHub</a></p>
<p>And it wasn’t reported from a non-technical person. It was reported by unman, a Qubes developer. So nobody else any idea how to fix it. Nobody commented since November 2022. That is to show the level of difficulty introduced by LVM. If there is a bug, then nobody has any clue how to fix it or even knows a workaround.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Default or non-default doesn’t even matter. It doesn’t change what I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>TPM in context of <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption">Full Disk Encryption (FDE)</a> is also not a priority at all.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Using full disk encryption with a strong password is more secure than using a TPM. This is elaborated here, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM">Full Disk Encryption, chapter TPM</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this context, it seems hard to add a TPM version because this would be difficult to communicate to the user.</p>
<p>“If you wish to use a less secure password and take your chances using a TPM, choose this option. Otherwise, it would be more secure to use a secure password instead.”</p>
<p>Under these conditions it doesn’t seem motivating to develop the TPM support feature.</p>
<p>Note: TPM support probably doesn’t necessarily need to be part of the installer such as calamares. If a user wants to set it up, they can set it up. The user could either,</p>
<ul>
<li>A) add an additional cryptsetup keyslot that uses the TPM; or</li>
<li>B) replace the cryptsetup password based keyslot with a TPM.</li>
</ul>
<p>So whether calamares adds support for TPM or not doesn’t prevent the user from making use of a TPM for full disk encryption. TPM setup would be <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Unspecific">unspecific to Kicksecure</a> and could be done as per <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Self_Support_First_Policy" class="inline-onebox">Self Support First Policy for Kicksecure</a>.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Some more detail since just “it’s no longer developed” may not be a satisfactory answer (after all forks are possible):</p>
<p>There are actually a very sizable number of distros that use Calamares as the default installer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kubuntu</li>
<li>Lubuntu</li>
<li>Ubuntu Unity</li>
<li>KaOS</li>
<li>Fedora Asahi Remix</li>
<li>Debian Live</li>
<li>Xebian</li>
<li>KDE neon</li>
<li>I <em>think</em> Artix Linux?</li>
<li>And of course Kicksecure</li>
<li>Ubuntu Studio previously used it but migrated to ubuntu-desktop-provision</li>
</ul>
<p>So it has quite a bit of usage, and there’s almost certainly some distros I’ve missed or haven’t seen yet that use it.</p>
<p>Ubiquity is rather Ubuntu-centric. I have only ever seen it used as the default installer for Ubuntu derivatives (whether those be official flavors like Ubuntu MATE or unofficial spinoffs like Mint, Trisquel, KXStudio, ChaletOS, etc). From having tried to work with its code, it is <em>not</em> fun to work with and those I know who have worked on it professionally were… less than thrilled. Even before it was finally deprecated it was being called outdated and bitrotten. Given it’s Ubuntu-centric nature, it may not be something that even <em>can</em> be used on other distros, though granted I haven’t looked into its internals closely enough to know for sure.</p>
<p>The LVM stuff in Calamares stinks, that is very true. Why, I don’t exactly know, maybe it’s because libkpmcore (which Calamares relies on for its partitioning work) is broken? However, I have worked on Calamares’ code upstream and it is very approachable. It’s mostly written in Qt/C++ which is a relatively friendly environment to work with, and some of it is written in Python which is even more friendly. So if LVM were to become a priority, it’s something I believe would be possible to fix. TPM-based FDE also is likely doable, depending on how exactly that’s being done in Ubuntu (though as Patrick mentions use of the TPM has worrying security issues that may make it not worth it or not a priority).</p>

<p>The comparison has some missing parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ubiquity released in 2006 (18 years ago), Calamares in 2015 (9 years ago)</li>
<li>Ubiquity is wider in usage, is the default installer for many and very famous distros (Ubunut, Mint…etc), Calamares is less in usage and distros which use it as a default installer are counted on less than the hand fingers.</li>
<li>Reliability of bug counts in Ubiquity ticketing system is unreliable e.g <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bug/1711358">This ticket</a> is fixed yet it still shown on <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/ubiquity/+bugs">the main page</a> as " *1 Open CVE bug".</li>
<li>Another thing to take care of is that “Open bugs” mean how many bugs are opened in the ticket system, “New Bugs” which mean that they are still unfixed bugs (called triaged/untriaged in their ticketing system).</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion: Based on the age and usage, this comparison has a neglected/no effect.</p>

<p>Everything has bugs but when it occurs/how much its usable is the question. by checking the bugs they are just uncommon/user specific use cases (4 bugs only).</p>
<p>Calamares on the other hand, their developers are just not well educated on how to implement LVM, to the level one opened a ticket to remove it because its just not working.</p>

</aside>
<p>Unrelated, as Qubes uses LVM by default (has 9 bugs only).</p>
<p>With server level or highly storage use cases, LVM is like a must to be available for ease and flexible for storage capacity scale (unless ditching server support).</p>

<p>Using full disk encryption with a strong password is more secure than using a TPM. This is elaborated here, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM">Full Disk Encryption, chapter TPM</a>.</p>

<p>The discussion is not about being used as a default method or how much its useful, but as a choice to the user, is it even available or not (specially in comparison to the upstream debian).</p>
<hr>
<p>One last thing i want to mention about Ubiquity, its written in python whereas Calamares written in C++.</p>

<p>In comparison. calamares has ~ 140 at time of writing.</p>
<p>I am not saying that one or the other has more bugs, that this is a useful comparison. This is just to say, that a port form calamares to Ubiquity is justified just because Ubiquity has some nicer features.</p>
<p>This is a hard engineering decision and would require a developer comparing the two. calamares might cause less effort because it’s used by default by Debian live.</p>

<p>LVM is not a priority at all.</p>
<p>I am reasonably technical person but even for me LVM is too much.</p>
<p>The bug reports against both installers calamares, ubiquity also discourages me to look further into LVM.</p>
<p>Also related, the <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=lvm+in%3Atitle+">fixed and unfixed list of Qubes LVM related issues</a>. Specifically the (nowadays fixed) <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/3243">LVM bug in Qubes that has lead to data loss when the “LVM pool” (or disk?) was filled up</a> (which could not be recovered from, at least most users could not).</p>
<p>As a challenge, try to boot from an external disk and then access your Qubes encrypted LVM on your internal hard drive for data recovery process. It’s possible but very difficult for users.</p>
