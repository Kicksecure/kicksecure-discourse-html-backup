    <title>DKMS build fail. Kernel update fail on fresh install</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/dkms-build-fail-kernel-update-fail-on-fresh-install/1511</link>
    <description>Using a verified fresh Kicksecure-LXQt-18.0.8.7.Intel_AMD64.iso I install from LIVE USB Sysmaint a Permanent Kicksecure system to a drive and reboot directly into the new system’s Sysmaint to begin a first update and upgrade. After 2 fresh new install attempts, updating with/without GUI/terminal, and debugging with apt it will still not let me update necessary linux images and headers. The same tirdad error remains after a fresh install. The only relevant logs I got are related to apt dependencies and configuration, but likely stemming from DKMS build failure. I have no experience with dkms, module building, or Debian build systems but I can only guess the build process cannot find or has no privilege to access pahole and possibly other necessary tools or files. I saved 2 logs from apt and dkms and from the dkms log:

&quot;/bin/sh: 1: pahole: not found &quot;

I was testing a new working system that was functional for a short while before the new linux image and header updates leading me to try an even newer install from the same, yet newest, ISO release. I apologize. I just do not know what specifically is wrong or where to learn more about it. Is this unspecific to Kicksecure?</description>

            <p>FWIW, I tested it, and was able to confirm that the initial upgrade of a fresh installation of Kicksecure 18 from the ISO works. Thanks for the update!</p>

            <p>I must humbly apologize. The brand new USB medium I bought was faulty. I did try to check both mediums for image integrity but I usually get no prompt or response when booting any USBs for integrity checks and certain tools. I am unsure if it doesn’t work with my BIOS settings since I disabled secure boot for compatibility and ease of use reasons. Ever since mainline grub or linux changed something with SHIM and secure boot I usually do not touch secure boot.</p>
<p>I will shortly delete this if necessary, but for clarity will remain for a bit for those unfortunate enough to have read it.</p>
