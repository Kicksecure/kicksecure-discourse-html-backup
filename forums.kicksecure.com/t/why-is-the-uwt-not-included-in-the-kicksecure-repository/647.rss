    <description>Why is the uwt package not included in the Kicksecure repository or included with Kicksecure by default? 

I went to see if its installed or available to install but its not in the repo.</description>

<p>Documentation was migrated from one project to another, if generic. Documentation might therefore have some imperfections.</p>
<p>Also the comment on top of that wiki page notifies:</p>

<p>but the package does not list uwt as dependency?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not a dependency as it is functional without uwt in Kicksecure.</p>

<p>is the reasoning cause it would leak with torsocks use on Kicksecure?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>The reason is that an elaborate Tor configuration (relevant here: multiple Tor <code>SocksPort</code>s) that Whonix has (<a href="https://github.com/Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config" class="inline-onebox">GitHub - Whonix/anon-gw-anonymizer-config</a>) doesn’t exist for Kicksecure.</p>

            <p>Ok, so I understand Kicksecure and Whonix have different goals but is the reasoning cause it would leak with torsocks use on Kicksecure?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/wiki/Dev/systemcheck#Security<br>
When manually running this test, attack surface for this script includes at least curl, apt, gpg, grep, sed, bash, <strong>uwt</strong>, torsocks, zenity, and pgrep. Kicksecure developers have assessed that the benefits of this check outweigh the potential risks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is on the wiki but the package does not list uwt as dependency?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Package: systemcheck<br>
Version: 3:30.5-1<br>

Depends: dist-base-files, python3, signify-openbsd, curl, ca-certificates, msgcollector, psmisc, sudo, vrms, libarchive-tools, helper-scripts, net-tools, systemd, adduser, security-misc, spectre-meltdown-checker, apparmor-profile-dist</p>
