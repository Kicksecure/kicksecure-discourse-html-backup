    <title>MicroKernel Archetecture is the Future</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/microkernel-archetecture-is-the-future/1156</link>
    <description>Sadly, there is no reliable or usable freedom operating system based on a microkernel design (yet). What we have are only monolithic ones, based on the Linux kernel.

Linux, by design, does not offer the same level of security as a microkernel. [It is considered obsolete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanenbaum%E2%80%93Torvalds_debate#Continued_dialogue); nobody would want to build an operating system from scratch based on a monolithic design in nowadays. 

Alternatives? 

- [seL4](https://sel4.systems/)
- [Redox](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/microkernels.html) 
- [Zircon](https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel)

All mentioned are in active development and free software (sel4 is copyleft). 

What i would avoid for sure is Zircon, because its google based.

What’s left are seL4 and Redox. Both are good, and if I had to choose one, I would choose seL4 due to its maturity.

Note (1): Minix and GNUmach are inactive.
Note (2): Hybrid kernel is not an option. 

# Freedom OSs Based on MicroKernels

## [seL4](https://sel4.systems/)

- [Sculp OS](https://genode.org/download/sculpt) (general-purpose OS, [Built on Genode](https://genode.org/index))

- [Lions OS](https://lionsos.org/)

## [Redox](https://doc.redox-os.org/book/microkernels.html) 

-  [Redox OS](https://www.redox-os.org/)

# Competitors 

Proprietary competitors are on the rise. HarmonyOS, for example, is arguably the most mature general-purpose microkernel-based OS developed in China. Google’s Fuchsia is another example. If we don’t stay ahead of these developments, control over security will slip from our hands, placing it instead in the hands of large corporations or state-backed entities.</description>

            <p>Could you elaborate on how this is particularly more secure than Qubes OS? I don’t think seL4 will be very suitable for this because of its likely very lacking hardware support (unless there’s an army of developers making networking and graphics drivers for seL4 that I don’t know about). Xen + a Linux dom0 seems like it probably gives similar levels of security to this.</p>
<p>Genode looks really cool, I didn’t know about it before. (Edit: Heh, looks like they’re using separate Linux VMs as both hardware and an application compatibility layers. Clever.)</p>
