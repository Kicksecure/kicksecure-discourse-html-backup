    <description>This idea was inspired by this users post:

&gt; https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/questions-regarding-use-of-tmpfs-formatting-and-conflicts/1057

Summery of idea in a nutshell is basically to make the package set /tmp mount point to tmpfs and add a `/etc/profile.d/` drop in to set the `XDG_CACHE_HOME=/tmp/.cache` variable for all users shell.

## Idea for /etc/profile.d/xdg-cache.sh

```
#!/bin/sh

## Set XDG_CACHE_HOME to a per-user cache directory.
#   Prefer a private sub-directory under /tmp when /tmp is a tmpfs.
#   Fall back to ${HOME}/.cache if /tmp is not a tmpfs.
#
## Detect whether /tmp is a mount point (i.e. a separate filesystem).
#    On most modern distros this will be a tmpfs, but on some it may
#    be a regular disk partition.
if grep -q &quot;^tmpfs.*/tmp.*tmpfs&quot; /proc/mounts || mountpoint -q /tmp; then

    # /tmp is a mount point - assume it is a tmpfs.
    BASE_ROOT=&quot;/tmp/${USER}&quot;
else
    # /tmp is part of the root filesystem (disk based).
    # Use the traditional default users /home based cache location instead.
    BASE_ROOT=&quot;${HOME}&quot;
fi

## Build the final cache directory path.
#    We always put the cache in a &quot;.cache&quot; sub-folder so that tools
#    that follow the XDG spec find what they expect.
CACHE_DIR=&quot;${BASE_ROOT}/.cache&quot;

## Ensure the directory exists and is private to the user.
#    /tmp is world-writable (drwxrwxrwt), so we must create a
#    private subtree and lock it down with chmod 700.
#
# Create the parent directory (only needed when we are using /tmp)
if [ &quot;${BASE_ROOT}&quot; != &quot;${HOME}&quot; ] &amp;&amp; [ ! -d &quot;${BASE_ROOT}&quot; ]; then
    mkdir -p &quot;${BASE_ROOT}&quot;
    chmod 700 &quot;${BASE_ROOT}&quot;          
fi

# Now create the .cache directory itself
mkdir -p &quot;${CACHE_DIR}&quot;
chmod 700 &quot;${CACHE_DIR}&quot;

## Export the variable so the rest of the session sees it.
export XDG_CACHE_HOME=&quot;${CACHE_DIR}&quot;
```

For the above To make it more bullet‑proof, you could tighten the /tmp detection for the `export XDG_CAHCE_HOME=&quot;/tmp/${USER}/.cache` creation

Systemd can generate a tmpfs mount for /tmp via the tmp.mount unit, but that unit is optional and can be disabled.
In live environments, the initramfs (often via dracut in Kicksecure case) typically mounts tmpfs at /tmp automatically.
Either the package should detect this and not interfere. otherwise a more robust way would be to ship `/etc/fstab` to be mounted to tmpfs by enabling and masking the builtin systemd unit, completely bypassing the need to fiddle with /etc/fstab. This is via enabling systemd’s tmp.mount unless it interferes with grub-live?

## Package Structure Summary Idea

```
tmpfs-setup package/
├── DEBIAN/
│   ├── control
│   ├── postinst
|   └── prerm (depending on implementation)
├── etc/
│   ├── default/
│   │   └── tmpfs-config
│   └── profile.d/
│       └── xdg-cache-home.sh
└── usr/
    └── share/doc/your-package/
        └── README.Debian
```

Would this be a good idea to implement or do you think its a waste of time since grub-live “Live Mode” already exists and it could complicate its implementation or conflict with it with complexity?

&gt;
&gt; &gt; Solaris has been doing this since 1994. (Much like other Unixes, too.) Debian’s next release defaults to tmpfs on /tmp, too. ArchLinux defaults to this as well. Ubuntu has plans for their 12.10 release.

&gt; www . debian. org/releases/trixie/release-notes/issues.en.html#the-temporary-files-directory-tmp-is-now-stored-in-a-tmpfs
&gt;
&gt; &gt; From trixie, the default is for the /tmp/ directory to be stored in memory using a tmpfs(5) filesystem. This should make applications using temporary files faster, but if you put large files there, you may run out of memory.</description>

<p>Exactly. It’s a feature “in the middle” between persistent mode and live mode.</p>
<p>We cannot maintain that. There are way too many features and too little (none) automated testing.</p>
