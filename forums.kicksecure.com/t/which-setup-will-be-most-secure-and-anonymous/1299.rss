    <title>Which setup will be most secure and anonymous?</title>

    <description>1. Kicksecure in live mode as Host OS, but as dualboot on second SSD (first SSD and boot for public use)
2. Kicksecure in live mode through USB (can be with physical write-protection if possible)
3. Kicksecure in live mode on external SSD
   I want to somehow do so i have in one main os windows for aaa gaming and public use, but in other os Kicksecure for private use in which i will be able to host whonix vm’s through kvm for sensitive use.  
   Which option will be best in this situation, maybe you have better solution?</description>

            <p>Booting into a Windows installation used for gaming while the Kicksecure drive is attached is most likely a bad idea, as gaming oftentimes involves installing and running not-totally-trusted software on the system. VMs on a USB flash drive are going to be painful, and live mode is not suitable for use with Whonix VMs unless you have a very large amount of RAM (64 GB at minimum, 128 GB or more would be better), as the entire virtual machine images will have to be loaded into RAM for this to work.</p>
<p>I think what you probably actually want is something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install Kicksecure on an external SSD in persistent mode. Use the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/ISO" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ISO</a> for this, enable disk encryption.</li>
<li>Install Whonix VMs on top of that, which are booted into persistent mode only for updates or installing software, and are booted into live mode otherwise.</li>
<li>Create a shared folder so you can persist data from the Whonix VMs that you want to keep without having to make the Whonix VMs themselves persistent. See <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/VirtualBox/Guest_Additions#Shared_Folder" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">VirtualBox Guest Additions: Clipboard Sharing, Shared Folder, and More</a> if you’re using VirtualBox, or <a href="https://www.whonix.org/wiki/KVM#Shared_Folders" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Whonix for KVM</a> if you’re using KVM.</li>
<li>Ensure the SSD is unplugged before booting into Windows.</li>
</ul>
