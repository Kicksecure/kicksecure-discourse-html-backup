    <title>Prevent specific packages from being installed?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/prevent-specific-packages-from-being-installed/916</link>
    <description>Is there anyway to prevent or &quot;blacklist&quot; certain packages from being installed?
I tried creating a preferences file `/etc/apt/preferences.d/pkg-blacklist` to set pin priority to prevent packages from being installed.


```
Package: rsh-client
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1

Package: geoclue-2.0
Pin: release *
Pin-Priority: -1
```

However I believe that if a package has these as a dependency it will still install them, is that true? 

If not them could something similar to this be utilized to Kicksecure to block certain packages from being installed that could be problematic to security and privacy?</description>
