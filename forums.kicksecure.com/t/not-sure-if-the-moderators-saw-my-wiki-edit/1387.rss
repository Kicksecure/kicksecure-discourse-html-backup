    <title>Not sure if the moderators saw my wiki edit</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/not-sure-if-the-moderators-saw-my-wiki-edit/1387</link>
    <description>I made wiki edit on the “Evil Maid Attack” page at the “Detection” section to describe a new anti evil maid tool I built called “Tripwire”, and added some more information to the other text. The editing process was pretty horrible. I can’t see my edit in my wiki account. Can a moderator confirm that they have seen the edit at least?</description>

            <p>Very cool, I can confirm I see the edit and the project looks neat! I’ll let <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> decide whether to accept the revision. (I have the ability to accept it, but my wiki powers were granted so I could do parts of my work on Kicksecure better and I’m not really a content moderator.)</p>

            <p>Thanks. For me the point of confusion was that even though I did click “Save Continue”, a new embedded window popped up and I closed it without actually saving. And submitting warned a loss of session data, as you said. I have saved and submitted again and it seems like it’s waiting for moderator’s approval now.</p>

            <p>It looks like the wiki software didn’t accept your edit. I can’t find your edit anywhere in the pending queue or in the edit history.</p>
<p>Oftentimes when editing a page, I get shown a notice that the edit wasn’t accepted because of a loss of session data. I have to scroll to the bottom of the page and click “Save” again for it to work. Maybe try adding it again?</p>
