    <title>Beyond Blocking Debian: Signed Onionized Sources for Qubes Template</title>

    <description>The Kicksecure Template for Qubes OS
still requires funding and development.
https ://www . kicksecure . com/wiki/Qubes

There seems to be no way to update from sources without special consideration paid to onionized sourcing when certain unattributed network obstacles persist.

Why does this happen? No one has explained.

Does anyone on this forum know why this is the case? Certainly, Debian does not targeted universal ban a computer user on any platform with roaming total coverage as a community. So the obstacle must be technical in nature. 

I am simply trying to get a VPN qube functional but all the Debian updates are blocked and the Fedora modifications are no doubt elaborate.</description>
