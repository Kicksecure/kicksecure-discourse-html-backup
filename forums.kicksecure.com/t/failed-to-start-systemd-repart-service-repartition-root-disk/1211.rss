    <description>Hi

Can anyone help, with why my VM&#39;s show this error on boot?
Everything works as expected though, except, but might not be related, many reboots hang on the &quot;Invalid DMI field header&quot; and I have to reset/stop-start the VM.
![image|690x438](upload://avwLj7luISzYzWqaK9ep4hO5EK2.png)

Running VirtualBox on Windows 11.
Guest OS is newest Kicksecure/whonix

Please let me know what info I can provide. I still new to Linux troubleshooting, so not sure what makes sense to post as info.

[EDIT] 
I noticed the Swap file notice, and have since given the VM more memory.
The info is gone, but the error is still present.
[/EDIT]
