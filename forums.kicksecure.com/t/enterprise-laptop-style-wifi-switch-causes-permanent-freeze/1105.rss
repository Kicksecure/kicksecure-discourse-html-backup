    <title>Enterprise Laptop style WiFi Switch causes Permanent freeze</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/enterprise-laptop-style-wifi-switch-causes-permanent-freeze/1105</link>
    <description>On my Dell Laptop it has a handy hardware WiFi Switch on the side that when switched/toggled it disables all Wireless (WWAN/WLAN/Bluetooth).

When booted from Live ISO (USB) on USER session or SYSMAINT session if I then go to toggle the WiFi switch to disable wireless at any given time it causes the system to permanently freeze. This is regardless if I connect to network first or not before toggling the switch.

To my knowledge Dell Laptops that are in the &quot;Enterprise&quot; category only come with these hardware style WiFi switches or these are just the ones that I have seen. I&#39;m not sure about other brands but it&#39;s nice for the obvious security reasons to disable wireless if you don&#39;t need or are using wired Ethernet connection specifically as I&#39;m doing.

Also why is `rfkill` not a included as a package or prepackages with the ISO?</description>

            <p>Oh wow I just realized that I needed to still use sudo in my commands in sysmaint mode. I thought for some reason the terminal was ran as sudo su in sysmaint control panel lol</p>
<p>Anyhow I was able to disable power saving mode but it still froze permanently after switching the WiFi hardware switch so that did not fix the issue.</p>

            <p>To provide additional context for my post, this is not related to the Kicksecure installation (I will test it later).<br>
This is just via LiveUSB and WiFi is working as I’m able to connect to network no problem.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[sysmaint ~]% iwconfig wlan0 | grep "Power Management"

            <p>My guess is its either network manager wifi power saving settings related or a driver related issue i.e. not installed…</p>
