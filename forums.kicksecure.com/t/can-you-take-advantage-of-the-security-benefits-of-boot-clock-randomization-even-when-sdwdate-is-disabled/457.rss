            <p>I have an Debian installation without kicksecure, but I notice that when I disable NTP services weeks later, the clock goes off by a few seconds, I notice this when the TOTP codes stop working.</p>
<p>is this common? well, that would explain why computers constantly synchronize their time</p>

            <p>In that case, you need to disable both. Boot Clock Randomization and<br>
sdwdate. In that case, you might be better off using an offline VM<br>
(“vault”).</p>

            <p>This is a problem for 2FA based on TOTP, unless the software runs its own independent clock, I don’t know of any that do that.</p>
