    <description>Its not only can cause a usability issue as [mentioned here](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Troubleshooting#Dual_Boot), but its a [security issue](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/multibooting-qubes/18988) as well: 

&gt; One problem is that when you dual or multiboot, even if you are using encryption on your Qubes installation, /boot is still unprotected and could be maliciously modified by the other OS, possibly leading to Qubes itself being maliciously modified.
&gt; 
&gt; The other problem is firmware security - for example the other system could infect the BIOS firmware, which might enable compromise or spying on the Qubes system.</description>

            <p>Might be worth drawing a line between “security support” and “technical support” here - multiboot may be very valuable for developer use cases (where all operating systems on the system are trusted equally). Such a setup may be discouraged from a security standpoint, but essential for development. I for instance run a multiboot setup on my test laptop, Kubuntu/Lubuntu/Qubes OS/Debian/Arch.</p>
<p>Qubes OS doesn’t <em>support</em> multiboot, but in practice it can be multibooted pretty easily.</p>
<p>Also, how would this interact with portable installations? They have some of the same risks, but may be very valuable because they can provide enhanced security even when a user has to use a machine that runs less secure operating systems other times.</p>
