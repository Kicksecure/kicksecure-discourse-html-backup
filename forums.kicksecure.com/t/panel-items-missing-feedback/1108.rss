    <title>Panel items missing [feedback]</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/panel-items-missing-feedback/1108</link>
    <description>I am reaching out to share some observations regarding missing panel items in the desktop settings for the two users (boot sessions), USER and USERMAINT. These issues were noticed while booting in Live Mode USB, and I believe it would be beneficial to me to provide my feedback.

- **USER**

  - *Power Manager Icon Missing* 
  The battery level indicator is absent from the system tray. This is particularly inconvenient for laptop users who rely on this feature to monitor their battery life.

- **USERMAINT**

  - *Power Manager Icon Missing* 
  Similar to USER, the battery level indicator is also missing.
  - *Time Clock Item Missing* 
  The Time Clock item is absent from the panel, which is a useful feature for quick access to the current time.
  - *Window Buttons Missing* 
  The absence of window indicators making it difficult to manage open windows. This has led to me to frustration while multitasking, such as when using the terminal to launch Firefox (look up issues) and Mousepad (take notes) and another xterm for debugging commands.
  
Its good to leave the USERMAINT desktop minimal but the three above would not be too much to add to the panel.</description>
