    <title>MacBook Pro keyboard backlight issue</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/macbook-pro-keyboard-backlight-issue/1462</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I can’t for the life of me workout how to adjust the keyboard backlight on my Intel MacBook Pro.

The “Keyboard &amp; Mouse” settings panel in KS is not an option because it is non-functional and the suggested workaround is beyond my pay grade at this early stage.

The actual keyboard ‘keys’ do nothing.

Tips and advice greatly appreciated.

Cheers.</description>

            <p>Wow, champion effort.</p>
<p>Worked like a treat! Thanks arraybolt3…</p>
<p>Now I am super impressed with Kicksecure, even in its own right.</p>
<p>Much, much more user friendly than TAILS OS.</p>
<p>More secure? I dunno, above my pay-grade, but, as a portable non-Windows/Apple OS, its a ripper.</p>
<p>(Having said that, TAILS OS is not going anywhere. I’ll use both…)</p>
<p>Cheers to the dev. team!</p>
<p>Awesome work, thanks.</p>

<p>Sorry for the delay, I got put on the naughty boy step for 2 hours because I exceeded my first day post limit…<img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=14" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"> .</p>

            <p>If I can get work time allocated to this, I’ll work on it. As a short-term solution, you can run something like this while booted into <code>PERSISTENT Mode | SYSMAINT Session | system maintenance tasks</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">cat &lt;&lt;EOF | sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/set-apple-kb-backlight.service
[Unit]
Description=Enable keyboard backlight on Apple systems

[Service]
Type=oneshot
RemainAfterExit=yes
ExecStart=bash -c -- 'echo 255 &gt; /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight/brightness'

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target sysmaint-boot.target
EOF
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable set-apple-kb-backlight.service
sudo systemctl start set-apple-kb-backlight.service
</code></pre>
<p>This should make the backlight immediately turn on, and it should be automatically turned on each time you boot up thereafter. If max brightness is too intense, change the <code>255</code> in <code>echo 255</code> to a smaller value. (This will create a new file at <code>/etc/systemd/system/set-apple-kb-backlight.service</code>, so if you need to change things later, that’s the file to change.)</p>
<p>(The ideal solution would be for Kicksecure’s backlight-tool to display the keyboard backlight as an additional device with controllable brightness, but that will take a lot longer to make happen.)</p>

            <p>That might be helpful just to make sure that the driver exists and is being loaded by default in Kicksecure, but it will almost certainly give similar or identical results (<code>brightness</code> might be a different value and the <code>trigger</code> contents might be a bit different but that’s the most I’d expect). If you’d like to do that, that would be great.</p>

<p>What would probably be most helpful is if you could share the output of <code>cd /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight &amp;&amp; grep . *</code>. This will show the names and contents of all the files in that directory. That might provide enough information to write a utility that will work with Kicksecure and will allow adjusting the backlight, and depending on how things go, that might be something that can be integrated into Kicksecure later (though <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> would be the one to decide that).</p>

            <p>This might be a tricky one. Apple keyboard backlights are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mac/Troubleshooting#Keyboard_backlight">apparently controlled by a sysfs file</a>, which likely requires administrator permissions to modify. Existing tools might not work with user-sysmaint-split installed unless they install a privileged background process that actually does the job of changing the backlight brightness. If you remove <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> though, you might be able to use something like <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/brightnessctl">brightnessctl</a> to adjust the keyboard backlight.</p>
<p>I unfortunately do not have an Intel-based Macbook to test with, so I can’t really create a tool for adjusting this that integrates with Kicksecure. (I made <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/desktop-config-dist/blob/master/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/backlight_tool_dist/backlight_tool_dist.py">a tool</a> for adjusting the display backlight, which is part of Kicksecure 18; a similar tool would probably work for the keyboard backlight, but would require someone with compatible hardware to create the tool or add support for keyboard backlight changing to the existing tool.)</p>
