    <title>MacBook Pro keyboard backlight issue</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/macbook-pro-keyboard-backlight-issue/1462</link>
    <description>Hi all,

I can’t for the life of me workout how to adjust the keyboard backlight on my Intel MacBook Pro.

The “Keyboard &amp; Mouse” settings panel in KS is not an option because it is non-functional and the suggested workaround is beyond my pay grade at this early stage.

The actual keyboard ‘keys’ do nothing.

Tips and advice greatly appreciated.

Cheers.</description>

            <p>Oh wow, that’s simpler than I thought. Will see if I can take a look at this soon, that looks like it should be pretty trivial to work with.</p>

<p>Tails doesn’t have user-sysmaint-split or a similar “isolate root access into a non-standard user account”, so it doesn’t have the same issues there. GNOME also has built-in support for adjusting the backlight.</p>

<p>What would probably be most helpful is if you could share the output of <code>cd /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight &amp;&amp; grep . *</code>. This will show the names and contents of all the files in that directory. That might provide enough information to write a utility that will work with Kicksecure and will allow adjusting the backlight, and depending on how things go, that might be something that can be integrated into Kicksecure later (though <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> would be the one to decide that).</p>

            <p>Thanks, I figured Apple would be behind yet another UEFI/BIOS hurdle.</p>

            <p>This might be a tricky one. Apple keyboard backlights are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mac/Troubleshooting#Keyboard_backlight">apparently controlled by a sysfs file</a>, which likely requires administrator permissions to modify. Existing tools might not work with user-sysmaint-split installed unless they install a privileged background process that actually does the job of changing the backlight brightness. If you remove <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> though, you might be able to use something like <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/brightnessctl">brightnessctl</a> to adjust the keyboard backlight.</p>
<p>I unfortunately do not have an Intel-based Macbook to test with, so I can’t really create a tool for adjusting this that integrates with Kicksecure. (I made <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/desktop-config-dist/blob/master/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/backlight_tool_dist/backlight_tool_dist.py">a tool</a> for adjusting the display backlight, which is part of Kicksecure 18; a similar tool would probably work for the keyboard backlight, but would require someone with compatible hardware to create the tool or add support for keyboard backlight changing to the existing tool.)</p>
