    <title>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections?</title>

    <description>How can I prevent any automatic unsolicited network connections in Kicksecure (at least temporarily), especially at system startup and when enabling a network connection?

At the very least, I would like to first put the whole network connection behind a VPN, notably to hide Tor traffic (generated by the secure NTP and the update check) from my ISP.

I can’t put a VPN on my router, so I have to enable it using the VPN’s software, but that requires connecting my PC to the internet first, (which generates Tor connections by default).</description>
