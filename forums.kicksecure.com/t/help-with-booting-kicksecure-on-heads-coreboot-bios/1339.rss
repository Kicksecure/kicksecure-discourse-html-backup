    <title>Help with booting Kicksecure on HEADS (coreboot) bios</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/help-with-booting-kicksecure-on-heads-coreboot-bios/1339</link>
    <description>Hello, this is my first post! :slight_smile: 

After playing with Kicksecure (template) on Qubes OS I tried to download the live iso and run it.

My computer has HEADS/coreboot as bios and Qubes OS as main OS. 

Unfortunately HEADS does not “see” Kicksecure and cannot launch it. 

The following github issue tracks the problem: https://github.com/linuxboot/heads/issues/2008 .
The main developer of HEADS ( https://github.com/tlaurion ) has replicated the issue. If you have any suggestion on how to fix it (or debug it), it would be very much appreciated. 

thank you in advance</description>

<p>Known issue, due to a Dracut bug. This is benign and can be ignored. I believe this will be resolved in Kicksecure 18, but it’s just cosmetic.</p>

</aside>
<p>I should add that while this allows to boot Kicksecure in HEADS (from recovery shell), and all seems to work fine, there is an error printed during the boot process:</p>
<p><code>simple-framebuffer simpler-framebuffer.0: Unable to register simpl [FAILED] Failed to mount sysroot.mount - /sysroot</code></p>
<p>I am not dure if this is a separate issue or not.</p>

<p>Yes, it is possible with the following commands in HEADS recovery shell:</p>
<p>``<br>

``</p>
<p>Would you be so kind to spell out what HEADS developers need to fix/develop in order to boot Kicksecure without issues? I will report the requirements to the Github issue.<br>
Thanks !</p>

            <p>Quoting from the linked issue:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Replicated. This is an hybrid ISO.<br>
The disk needs to be mounted (sda here) not a subpartition to discover rootfs and its boot related files).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least to me this sounds like a limitation of Heads itself and not something Kicksecure can work around. You might be able to mount the disk itself (not a subpartition) in the recovery shell, then manually boot from that mounted device, but I don’t know if Heads supports that. Until Heads gains support for this, we’d need to have a Heads-specific ISO, which I don’t think it feasible (especially since our ISO creation tooling is handled by live-build right now, and we don’t customize how it does the generation of the ISO itself to my awareness).</p>
<p>I did have a slightly crazy idea for getting this to work anyway… quoting a slightly modified version of my messages from the Heads room:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This might be a kind of crazy idea, but what if there were a fourth partition on the USB, which encompassed the whole entire disk, such that /dev/sda4 was then essentially an alias of /dev/sda?<br>
would Heads then be able to boot from /dev/sda4, and then the initramfs of Kicksecure be able to find the live OS at /dev/sda?<br>
I’m not sure we could work something like that into Kicksecure’s build system, but it might be possible to document it as a workaround.<br>
I don’t have any device running Heads here to test on, but if that sounds plausible and it works when someone tries it, it might be something we could document.</p>
