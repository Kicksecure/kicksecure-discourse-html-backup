    <description>I tested the new version. It seems to be working great. The only issue is that I couldn&#39;t change theme and background in sysmaintenance mode. Only the theme in the window manager changes. But maybe that&#39;s how you intended it. 
The panel is very convenient! It just lacks buttons for viewing the log and searching the log by keyword. This would make the panel perfect and improve the convenience of administration - it&#39;s convenient to administer the system in a few clicks.
Will the maintenance panel be translated into other languages in the future?
Thank you</description>

<p>Good catch, we should fix that.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is not a problem. The panel requires only a minimal knowledge of English + there is a live mode for testing, where users from different countries can try out what they are unfamiliar with or do not understand.<br>
Thank you very much for your work!</p>

            <p>It seems that old, outdated information is present after systemcheck in user session mode. If there are new updates, it is recommended to open the terminal in Start menu and enter ‘upgrade-nonroot’. However, the current accurate information is to reboot and start a sysmaint session for updates. This information is also not relevant for the sysmaint session, as there is no Start menu there. Otherwise, the system works perfectly - I have installed programs, uninstalled programs, tried various settings, run programs under different users, and tested all the panel buttons.</p>

<p>Right now the background is hardcoded, though it differs between Kicksecure, Whonix-Gateway, and Whonix-Workstation. In theory it could be made configurable, I’m not sure if that’s a good idea though since right now the background allows easy identification of the underlying OS (which is useful if you have multiple VMs of different kinds running at the same time).</p>

<p>Oooh, that’s not a bad idea. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a>, what do you think? That would in theory be easy to add.</p>
