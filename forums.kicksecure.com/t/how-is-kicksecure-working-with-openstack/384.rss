    <title>How is Kicksecure working with Openstack?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/how-is-kicksecure-working-with-openstack/384</link>
    <description>Is there anyone using or tried to use Kicksecure to run Openstack? How is Kicksecure working with Openstack components? Are they working fine? Please share your experience with it!
I was looking for a security oriented Debian-based distro as my Linux server to host Openstack undercloud, overcloud and guest VM as servers for our service. I just want to know your experience on working with it as a server.
Thanks!</description>
