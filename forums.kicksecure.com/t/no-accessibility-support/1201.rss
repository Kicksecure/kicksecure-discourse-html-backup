    <description>People with special needs should have their own operating system, potentially even supervised by medical professionals, as each case may require specific tools depending on individual needs (vision, hearing, touch, speech ..etc).

This should not be a concern for the project, as it does not target this field.

Not to mention the effort, bulk code, and other complexities involved. Therefore, it is not supported.</description>
