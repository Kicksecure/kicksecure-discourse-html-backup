    <title>Avoid clearnet traffic in Kicksecure</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/avoid-clearnet-traffic-in-kicksecure/1055</link>
    <description>My aim is to avoid outgoing clearnet traffic.

Is it right that in the default installation of Kicksecure only the following outgoing traffic is torified?

* automatic and manual updates from Kicksecure repository or using sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
* using sudo apt update 
* using sudo apt full-upgrade
* installing new software with sudo apt install

Is it correct that when not starting any apps that open a connection there won&#39;t be any outgoing clearnet traffic, i.e. after starting Kicksecure and leave it idle or only installing and updating software there will be no outgoing clearnet traffic?</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>That should be the case.</p>
<p>But, quote <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Fingerprint" class="inline-onebox">Network, Browser and Website Fingerprint</a></p>
<blockquote>
<h1>Non-Existing Network Fingerprint Research and Implementation</h1>
<p>What does <strong>not</strong> exist according to publicly available information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A)</strong> No phone home research: A research term that continuously verifies that no software installed by default (or usually installed) in Kicksecure exhibits any phone home activity over clearnet by default.</li>
<li><strong>B)</strong> No fingerprint research: A research term that continuously analyzes the network fingerprints of Microsoft Windows, Debian, TBB, Tails, Whonix, Kicksecure, etc., across different hardware setups, and publishes the results.</li>
<li><strong>C)</strong> No fingerprint emulation development team: Based on the above research, a development team aiming to emulate popular network fingerprints.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>And.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Kicksecure: Might get a feature to restrict outgoing traffic to specific Linux user accounts and/or IP addresses. But it’s not yet implemented. For latest status, see ticket: <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-firewall/378">Kicksecure Firewall</a></p>
