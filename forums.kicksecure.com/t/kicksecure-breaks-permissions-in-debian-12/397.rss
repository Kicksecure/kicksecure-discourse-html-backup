    <title>Kicksecure Breaks permissions in Debian 12</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-breaks-permissions-in-debian-12/397</link>
    <description>After installing kicksecure, I am no longer able to save files via programm installed, and run, under a user account.

I only have one primary account, and I cannot get programs executed under said account to execute with same privileges.

so bug in kicksecure, and how to fix please?</description>

            <p>so, TYPICALLY when I have installed programs, usually through apt, .deb packages, or through something like dkpg or software manager in ‘mint’, the program installs, and when launched under my [username] credentials ‘inherits’ those rights by default.</p>
<p>Admittedly, this is not always the case; however often there will be a sudo challenge ‘enter your password’</p>
<p>in this instance the program in question needs to know where to ‘save’ a file in the ‘save file dialog’ accessing other drives already mounted under ‘current user’ are ‘permission denied’</p>
<p>Expected behavior is that programs launched under ‘current user’ inherrit same permissions.</p>
<p>Answering your direct questions.</p>
<p>quote: I don’t think Kicksecure modifies anything for any arbitrary program.</p>
<p>makes sense, but seems to be some ‘blanket’ policy</p>
<p>I can access the drives directly from CLI, and caja without SU; however in NEARLY ALL DEBIAN VARIANTS (sorry caps)(debian,ubuntu,mint) I find it necessary to enter ‘disks’ or ‘gnome-disks’ goto 'mount options, and ‘uncheck’ auto, and whatever is the default seems to work fine.</p>
<p>all disks mount at start and dont give any issues related to permission,more or less maybe root, but not other drives. generally other, non system drives just work.</p>
<p>I have unchecked the ‘automount’, and as stated these work fine in other areas such as caja, CLI, but programs have issues accessing them.</p>
<p>I generally have not found it necessary to create ‘groups’ and usernames for programs to have access. what this bings to mind now though is one time several years ago I followed some instructions on installing bittorrent on linux mint, and I was required to create a username and group, and it was started and run as a service. without that, it too had a similar ‘permission’ issue.</p>
<p>Honestly, after the hundres of hours I have spen trying to remedy the issue, I just dont have it in me to reinstall debian 12 configure it, test it, install kicksecure, test it again.</p>
<p>I may sometime, but im spent. I need it to work right now, and if I cant, I will have to get something that will work.</p>
<p>for what its worth, thank you for you help.</p>

            <p>You’re not providing instructions on what exactly you did. Hence, I cannot reproduce the issue. Therefore the low chance for a fix got even lower.</p>

<p>I don’t think Kicksecure modifies anything for any arbitrary program.</p>
<p>If you cannot access it from command line then a program will likely also not be able to access the folder.</p>
<p>So there’s no inheritance issue.</p>

<p>How was that created?</p>
<p>Are you sure that works different in Debian vs Kicksecure?</p>
<p>There was an issue with auto mounting in the past:<br>
