    <title>Tor removed Tor2Web mode so wiki article needs updating</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/tor-removed-tor2web-mode-so-wiki-article-needs-updating/1330</link>
    <description>Article &quot;Non Anonymous Onion Encryption and NAT Traversal&quot; mentioned building Tor software with Tor2Web mode but this build option has been removed by Tor Project a long time ago (since 0.3.5.1-alpha in 2018):

`https://github.com/torproject/tor/blob/maint-0.3.5/ChangeLog#L888`

I don’t know how to update this article because I don’t understand how to change this. Does having to jump through 4 hops instead of 6 still delivers the purpose of being faster/lower latency NAT traversal? Or is it preferred we remove this article as a whole?</description>
