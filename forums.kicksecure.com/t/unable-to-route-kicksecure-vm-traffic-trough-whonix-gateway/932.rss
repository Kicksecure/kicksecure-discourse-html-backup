    <title>Unable to route kicksecure vm traffic trough whonix gateway</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/unable-to-route-kicksecure-vm-traffic-trough-whonix-gateway/932</link>
    <description>For testing purposes id like to route the traffic of the kicksecure virtual machine traffic trough the whonix gateway.
In all other VMs i change the ipv4 to manual  
address: 10.152.152.12 Netmask:255.255.192.0 Gateway: 10.152.152.10 DNS: 10.152.152.10
And it works just fine, however when i do the same in a kicksecure VM....crickets.
What am i doing wrong my duck search didnt provide any workarounds.</description>

            <p>There might be an issue with Tor inside your Kicksecure.</p>
<p>Tor over Tor is to be avoided anyhow.</p>
<p>You could follow “<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Tor#Update_without_Tor">Kicksecure documentation for Update without Tor</a>”, but your updates would still be over Tor, if routed through Whonix-Gateway. But you’d avoid the nested Tor over Tor issue.</p>

            <p>Thank you one “small” problem the kicksecure doesnt want to update when im on tor for some reason. I have internet connection i can enter sites and download stuff in terminal but when i try to update it displays errors. Works fine when i set it back to NAT but when im on whonix it spits this:</p>

            <p>Kicksecure at time of writing uses <code>NetworkManger</code>.<br>
Not <code>ifupdown</code>. Therefore not file <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code>.</p>
<p>Confirm your network settings.</p>
<pre><code>sudo ifconfig
</code></pre>
