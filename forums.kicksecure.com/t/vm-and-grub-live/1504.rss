    <description>I installed KickSecure on a laptop with 8GB of RAM, installed VirtualBox and VMs (specifically Whonix Gateway and WorkStation) in persistence mode, took a snapshot of the VMs in VirtualBox, and then launched KickSecure in live boot to launch Whonix. But sometimes I get a notification that says “livecheck: the system’s live status has changed.current status:grub-live-semi-persistence-unsafe”. is. Are there traces on SSDs? Also, Are there any risks in forensic analysis? (Veracrypt, external SSD, HDD, USB memory is not used.))</description>

            <p>Which filesystems are writeable? To find out, you can left click on the live check icon. It’s the green icon which turns red if writeable filesystems are detected.</p>
<p>Or you could run:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/get_writable_fs_lists.sh
</code></pre>
<p>That would output all writeable filesystems in the terminal. That’s the same tool that the livecheck systray uses internally.</p>

<p>Development comment:<br>
We might want to move that file to /usr/bin and rename it to make it more easily accessible.</p>
