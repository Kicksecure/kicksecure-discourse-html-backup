    <description>I installed KickSecure on a laptop with 8GB of RAM, installed VirtualBox and VMs (specifically Whonix Gateway and WorkStation) in persistence mode, took a snapshot of the VMs in VirtualBox, and then launched KickSecure in live boot to launch Whonix. But sometimes I get a notification that says “livecheck: the system’s live status has changed.current status:grub-live-semi-persistence-unsafe”. is. Are there traces on SSDs? Also, Are there any risks in forensic analysis? (Veracrypt, external SSD, HDD, USB memory is not used.))</description>

            <p>Probably. What I mean by that, if that script shows no writable filesystems, if <code>mount</code> shows no unexpected writeable filesystems (except overlay), then it’s as safe as it can reasonably get. → <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live#Security_Considerations">Security Considerations</a></p>
<p>That still begs the question why this happens:</p>

</aside>
<p>To find that out, we probably need to add debug output to livecheck and log it to <code>journalctl --user</code> in a future version.</p>

            <p>I didn’t see anything in the terminal after running that command. Also, the green icon is not red, and it says "LiveMode Active:yes Persistent Mode Active:no No Changes will be made to disk. "is displayed. I also ran “sudo journalctl --list-boots”, but there was no record of the time I livebooted. Probably safe?</p>

            <p>Which filesystems are writeable? To find out, you can left click on the live check icon. It’s the green icon which turns red if writeable filesystems are detected.</p>
<p>Or you could run:</p>
<pre><code>/usr/libexec/helper-scripts/get_writable_fs_lists.sh
</code></pre>
<p>That would output all writeable filesystems in the terminal. That’s the same tool that the livecheck systray uses internally.</p>
<hr>
<p>Development comment:<br>
We might want to move that file to /usr/bin and rename it to make it more easily accessible.</p>
