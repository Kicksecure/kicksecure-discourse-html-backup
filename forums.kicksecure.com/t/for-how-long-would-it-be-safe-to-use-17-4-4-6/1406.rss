    <title>For how long would it be safe to use 17.4.4.6?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/for-how-long-would-it-be-safe-to-use-17-4-4-6/1406</link>
    <description>The question goes for whonix 17 also, but to put it mildly 18 needs a bit of polishing, the main thing is that i need copy paste and with the wayland bug on virtualbox I aint getting that. Also for some reason KVM slows down my machine to a craw.
So the question is for how long will the 17.4.4.6 versions of whonix and kick be safe to use?</description>

<p>Are there specific things that need polishing (beyond the one mentioned here)? From our standpoint Kicksecure 18 is stable, and while we are still polishing some things to make them more user-friendly, it’s very possible we’ll miss things if they aren’t pointed out. (Everyone’s use case is different, so we’re naturally more likely to notice issues that impact our workflows, and we don’t have telemetry to tell us what other people’s workflows are.)</p>

<p>Yeah, that is a problem. We’re somewhat at the mercy of Oracle here, once they fix it things should work, but until then we’re sort of stuck in a bind. (KVM is busted in a similar way, no working Wayland support in spice-vdagent.) Shared folders can be used as a workaround.</p>

<p>Usually previous major versions of Kicksecure are considered end-of-life pretty shortly after new major version are released. Because of Qubes OS considerations, we’ll probably support version 17 for another couple of months or so, but I wouldn’t expect it to be much longer than that.</p>
