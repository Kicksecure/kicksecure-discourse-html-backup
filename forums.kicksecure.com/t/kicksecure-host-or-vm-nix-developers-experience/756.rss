    <description>How do you use Kicksecure yourself? Do you think Kicksecure is the most secure host OS (or the most secure Debian OS?) or do you use it in a VM, with host Fedora, NixOS, Alpine, openSuse, Qubes..? The developers&#39; experience is very important and interesting. After all, you&#39;ve studied many Linux distributions and are creating Kicksecure based on the experience of using other systems. I&#39;m interested in your opinion at the end of 2024. And what do you think about using Nix manager in Kicksecure? What do you think about using distrobox with podman to install packages in Alpine, Fedora or other secure distros?</description>

            <p>In order to move forward, one must pave stone ahead. There are also holes that takes lot of resources and isn’t worth it. <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> and he’s team is doing their best. It’s just not easy to pave them especially when the distribution’s ancestor made limitation or lack of documentation.</p>
<p>Despite all the challenges they face, I’m glad that they’re still on the right track.<br>
Let’s wait for Whonix-Host, because KickSecure might disappear after becomes publicly available.</p>

            <p>My expectation to Kicksecure is to become a good server/desktop distro. But too many things are not working correct.</p>
