    <description>Well, there’s a first time for everything.

Just installed Kicksecure on my NVMe SSD instead of another MicroSD card. Whoohoo…

Works a treat, but…</description>

            <p>True.</p>
<p>I’m generally of the mind, with electronics, if it works once then its usually human error if it stops working. I’ll wear it… but it is annoying.</p>
<p>Part of my problem is I’m using a 27” QHD external monitor and the default font size is super tiny, so I choose to blame my aged eyes.</p>
<p>I do have other questions so I’ll hit the FAQ’s etc. and see how I go. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            <p><code>mmcblk0p1</code> and <code>nvme0n1p1</code> are easy to confuse (I almost confused them recently). It’s also easy to mix up the <code>sdX</code> that points to your hard drive and the <code>sdY</code> that points to a USB drive. I haven’t done it <em>yet</em>, but if you’re moving fast, and especially if you’re using tab completion, things could go wrong.</p>

            <p>Well, it did it again.</p>
<p>And, this time it wasn’t me… WTF.</p>
<p>So, after 2 hours messing around re-installing Linux Mint, reformatting USB/MicroSD cards, etc. etc., my second attempt to create a ‘persistent’ storage USB-A from an operational MicroSD card failed and rewrote my hard drive instead of the selected USB-A drive.</p>
<p>Second time today, and only the second time in 50 years I’ve done it.</p>
<p>I’m suspicious that ‘it wasn’t me’.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Thanks for that.</p>
<p>Nah, its not really a big issue. I have always stored important stuff in Proton Drive or off-device, so no great losses.</p>
<p>I was planning to upgrade my NVMe anyway. The device I have is only 256GB, so 512GB was on my short-term agenda.</p>
<p>Also, getting a bit sick of Linux Mint’s increasing ‘bloat’ and thought I’d like to go Debian for a try…</p>
<p>So, all good really. Plenty of drive space now and a new learning curve, plus I already have KS setup to my liking, very easy to do ultimately.</p>
<p>Cheers though.</p>
<p>(P.S. Keyboard backlight code you sent worked a treat, again.That’s a keeper.</p>
<p>)</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.cgsecurity.org/wiki/photoRec">PhotoRec</a> may prove useful. (Used this to recover important data after I unintentionally did a recursive delete on <code>$HOME</code>.) It’s in the Debian archives, install it on one of your SD card or USB installations of Kicksecure using <code>sudo apt install testdisk</code>. You’ll need an external drive around the same size as your SSD for PhotoRec to save recovered data to, and you’ll need to be booted from an external USB to use it.</p>
<p>Whatever you do, power off the system ASAP and don’t use the internal SSD for anything until you’ve recovered data from it. The longer you use it, the lower the chances of recovering important data.</p>
