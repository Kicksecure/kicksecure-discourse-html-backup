    <title>Forensic after deleting VMs</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/forensic-after-deleting-vms/1021</link>
    <description>Hello. I am using Kicksecure and Whonix on a virtual machine. Usually, I use live mode. If I delete these virtual machines, what level of danger exists in case of forensic examination? Or do these metadata not pose any danger? I understand that the best option would be to use Kicksecure-host in live mode, but I am interested in your opinion on virtual machines. Disk of course encrypted. There are many opinions on this topic. But you are the best security experts and I am very interested in your opinion. I think that the metadata in log does not pose a threat, otherwise you would not created Whonix and Kicksecure as virtual machines. But your answer is very important to me. Thank you</description>
