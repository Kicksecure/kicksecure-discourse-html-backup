    <title>Use GUID Partition Table (GPT) by default</title>

    <description>Quote ticket [calamares - use gpt by default](https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/todo#calamares_-_use_gpt_by_default):

&gt; * Patrick: bug: unencrypted installations are mbr by default
&gt; * Patrick: todo: port from [master boot record (MBR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_boot_record) to [GUID Partition Table (GPT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table), if sane
&gt; * Aaron: Likely not a good idea until a Calamares release with https://github.com/calamares/calamares/pull/2422 in it is made (the version in Trixie doesn&#39;t have this yet). We&#39;d have to introduce a bios-grub partition unconditionally on both EFI and BIOS, and only one bootloader would be installed. This would mean that BIOS systems would end up with a bios_boot partition and no ESP, while EFI systems would get both bios_boot and ESP partitions but only an EFI bootloader installed. Once the linked PR is present in a release, we will be able to always have both partitions and both bootloaders.
&gt;   * Aaron: Technically GRUB can be installed on BIOS systems without a bios_boot partition, but `grub-install` must be run with `--force` to do this, and the bootloader may break at any time if this is done. See https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/index.php?32391#comment1:

&gt;&gt; The blocklists are unreliable because the filesystems can move the files around at will and so the exact sectors are subject to change. Any such change creates both a reliability and security problem. Previously the blocks were only rarely moved around. However, now, with features like tail repacking and online defragmenter it will become increasingly of a problem.</description>
