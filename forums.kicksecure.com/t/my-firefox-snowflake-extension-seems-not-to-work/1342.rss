    <title>My Firefox Snowflake extension seems not to work</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/my-firefox-snowflake-extension-seems-not-to-work/1342</link>
    <description>Hi,

The Snowflake extension in my firefox browser never show any counter, as it usually does in other OSs I use. It remains purple instead of being green. It’s like it is not working (whereas I activated it).

Is there some rule to give to my firewall ? Something I missed ?

Thanks for your help,</description>
