    <title>My Firefox Snowflake extension seems not to work</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/my-firefox-snowflake-extension-seems-not-to-work/1342</link>
    <description>Hi,

The Snowflake extension in my firefox browser never show any counter, as it usually does in other OSs I use. It remains purple instead of being green. It’s like it is not working (whereas I activated it).

Is there some rule to give to my firewall ? Something I missed ?

Thanks for your help,</description>

            <p>Welcome nearkick, What browser are you using?</p>
<p>Last I checked Snowflake’s core transport is built on WebRTC data channels. So if your using something like Librewolf or did some kind of hardening to your browser good chance this is related to WebRTC being disabled in the browser. The other might be some kind of sandboxing issue?</p>
