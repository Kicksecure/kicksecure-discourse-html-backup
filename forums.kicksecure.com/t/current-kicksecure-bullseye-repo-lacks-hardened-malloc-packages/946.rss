    <title>Current Kicksecure Bullseye repo lacks hardened-malloc packages?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/current-kicksecure-bullseye-repo-lacks-hardened-malloc-packages/946</link>
    <description>Hello,

I wanted to update a VM that has not been updated for a while.
Unfortunately, the hardened-malloc package is no longer offered. Is there a reason for this and can the package be offered again via the Kicksecure Bullseye repo?

The hardened-malloc package is currently not available in any Bullseye repo, not in Stable, Stable Proposed, Testers, nor in Developers.

Last available version was:
hardened-malloc (0:12.5-1) unstable

Best regards</description>
