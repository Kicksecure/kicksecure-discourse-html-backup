            <p>Are you talking about file <em>formats</em> or file <em>systems</em> here? File formats refer to specific types of files; TXT, PNG, and MP4 are all file formats. File systems are ways in which files are stored on a physical drive, regardless of the file format used for each file. NTFS, ext4, and exFAT are examples of file systems.</p>
<p>If you’re talking about file systems, the best one to use for transferring files between different OSes is usually exFAT - both Windows and Linux have good read/write drivers for it, and it can handle files larger than 4 GB without problems. It has some file name restrictions, and it doesn’t understand what file permissions are, but neither of those things will usually be a problem. If you’re just trying to get files from one system onto another, that’s what I would use.</p>
<p>If you’re talking about file formats, the best format to use will depend heavily on what kind of files you’re working with. In general, proprietary, program-specific file formats are more likely to be a problem than generic file formats. For instance, PSD images are Photoshop-specific and will probably give you more drouble than JPEG images. I’d need to know what kinds of files you’re moving to be more specific than that.</p>
