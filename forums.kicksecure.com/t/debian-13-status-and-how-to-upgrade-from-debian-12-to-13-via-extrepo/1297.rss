    <description>How is the development status for Debian 13? From what I see here, Debian 13 hasn&#39;t been added into extrepo data yet. https://salsa.debian.org/extrepo-team/extrepo-data/-/blob/master/repos/debian/kicksecure.yaml?ref_type=heads

I enabled Kicksecure repo from extrepo. How do I upgrade everything from Debian 12 to 13 from the repo contained in extrepo?</description>

<p>Great. So no feature will be added and only bug fixes, so everything will run stable. One more reason to use Xorg over Wayland. But I prefer we keep both in use.</p>

  <pre><code class="Markdown"># Think twice before abandoning X11. Wayland breaks everything!

&lt;!-- [![image](https://gist.github.com/user-attachments/assets/98ec6c1c-bd7f-427c-a2da-a9802a645373)](https://x.com/LundukeJournal/status/1940441670098809093) --&gt;

Wayland breaks everything! It is binary incompatible, provides no clear transition path with 1:1 replacements for everything in X11, and is even philosophically incompatible with X11. Hence, if you are interested in existing applications to "just work" without the need for adjustments, then you may be better off avoiding Wayland.

**Wayland solves no issues I have but breaks almost everything I need.** Even the most basic, most simple things (like `xkill`) - _in this case with no obvious replacement_. And usually it stays broken, because the Wayland folks mostly seem to care about Automotive, Gnome, maybe KDE - and alienating everyone else (e.g., people using just an X11 window manager or something like GNUstep) in the process.

<blockquote>
<p>and will contain obvious fewer security flaws than Wayland.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t believe this is the case. Wayland doesn’t rely on simply being a better display server implementation for security, it does a number of things that fundamentally make it less of a security hazard than X11 even <em>if</em> the compositor or libraries it depends on contain security vulnerabilities. For instance:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://X.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">X.org</a> traditionally runs as root (and I believed ran as root even in Kicksecure 17), meaning a compromise of the display server is equivalent to a compromise of the entire system. Wayland runs in a logged-in unprivileged user account.</li>
<li><a href="http://X.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">X.org</a> exposes its IPC sockets in a world-writable location, increasing the risk that a malicious process running as a restricted user like <code>man</code> could compromise the server. Wayland saves its IPC sockets in <code>/run/user/UID</code>, which is only available to the logged-in user itself. Thus applications are authenticated to the server just by virtue of being able to connect to the socket, and unauthorized applications are unable to connect because of kernel-level filesystem restrictions.</li>
</ul>
<p>These two advantages alone are huge because it means that almost any application that could connect to and compromise the Wayland server, most likely would gain no further access to the system by doing so (the only exception would be GUI applications with AppArmor sandboxes). An application <em>might</em> compromise the Wayland server to read the window contents of other applications or sniff keystrokes, but these are both things that <a href="http://X.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">X.org</a> allows by design, so there’s no additional risk there. The display server goes from being a highly valuable exploit target to being relatively uninteresting. Even if labwc (our chosen Wayland compositor) or wlroots (the library it uses to implement a Wayland compositor) turns out to be riddled with security holes, it’s still better than a nearly bulletproof X11 would be (and X11 is not nearly bulletproof).</p>

</aside>
<p>X <em>was</em> a more stable platform, and for a limited set of applications it is is preferable to Wayland. The <code>X.org</code> server however has been abandoned upstream, and is for the most part deprecated and bitrotting (this is beginning to show with application support, toolkit support, and driver support, and will get worse over time most likely). Moving to Wayland is not simply a security enhancement move, it is vital for ongoing usability in the future.</p>

  <p>There have a few Wayland specific forum threads but none generally about a port to Wayland.  Make sure Whonix tools support Wayland was done.  Currently there is no clear way forward Wayland support… Except, waiting for Xfce to become Wayland...</p>

            <p>Oh I see. Thank you.</p>
<p>But I think move to Wayland is not a smart move. X has been used for a long time and it is more stable.</p>
<p>By the way, I don’t see any discussion in Kicksecure forum about move from X to Wayland?</p>

<p>You aren’t using full Kicksecure, you’re using Kicksecure packages on top of Debian, so the <code>release-upgrade</code> script will almost certainly not work for you. It is designed to upgrade a full Kicksecure installation. Regardless though, you still should not be trying to upgrade yet. (We’re still finding and working out bugs; the Wayland and LXQt transition has taken quite a bit of development work to get right.)</p>

            <p>It still is probably a good idea to wait for Kicksecure 18 to be released, since those package’s contents may change substantially and there may be upgrade issues with them if you try to upgrade now.</p>

            <p>Kicksecure 17 is based on Debian 12 (Bookworm) and is <strong>not</strong> compatible with Debian 13 (Trixie). Kicksecure 18 will be based on Debian 13.</p>
<p>Kicksecure 18 is still in (very active) development, it isn’t suitable for daily use or beta testing yet (though it may be pretty close to beta-testable). When it is available, you will be able to upgrade an existing Kicksecure 17 installation using a <code>release-upgrade</code> script, and ISOs and VM images will be available for clean installation. Until it is released however, do not attempt to upgrade your system to Debian 13, you <em>will</em> break your system.</p>

From what I see here, Debian 13 hasn’t been added into extrepo data yet. <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/extrepo-team/extrepo-data/-/blob/master/repos/debian/kicksecure.yaml?ref_type=heads" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">repos/debian/kicksecure.yaml · master · External repositories team / extrepo-data · GitLab</a></p>
