    <description>Hi. Sorry, I am very beginner to Linux OS, but I have spent 6 hours today and was not able to figure this out.

**Some INFO:**
- So, I installed Kicksecure from Kicksecure ISO following this guide kicksecure . com/wiki/ISO and pressed &quot;Install to hardrive&quot; and installed it to my SSD. During installation my internet cable from my home router was plugged in (dunno if that matters)

**What is the problem?**
- After installation finished, I booted the Kicksecure OS and everything seem to work, except my internet from my Ethernet cable. 
Note: I tried plugging a wireless card and the internet would instantly work via WIFI (after plugging i did apt-get update &amp;&amp; upgrade). Also, on other OS on same PC, my internet through cable would work instantly. I guess that it is something with Kicksecure settings that is not working for me.

**What did I do?**
Well since I am a noob I was searching and trying different suggested ideas, mainly from Debian 12 (bookworm). 
- First thing i noticed I did not have /etc/network/interfaces so I tried creating that with different settings like:

```
auto lo
iface lo inet loopback

auto eth0
allow-hotplug eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
```
that only made my &quot;Ethernet: wired connection 1&quot; disappear in my nm-connection-editor. So, I removed that and started searching again.Then I read all of this forums.whonix . org/t/kicksecure-network-configuration/8985/52 and my head started to hurt. But what i understood (and maybe that is wrong) that network on Kicksecure is configured in their own unique way, not like Debian 12 /etc/network/interfaces. That realization did not help me much tho. I then noticed my connection did not have any IPv4, only IPv6. So I tried manually imagining what my IP could look like if it was static, since usually everything is DHCP. So I tried adding in my NetworkManager Applet

```
IP Address: 192.168.1.15
Netmask: 255.255.255.0
Gateway: 192.168.1.254
DNS servers: 192.168.1.254 (also tried 8.8.8.8)
```
All that did was - that instead of ```ping 8.8.8.8 Network unreachable ``` I started getting 
```
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8) 58 (84) bytes of data.
From 192.168.1.15 icmp_seq=1 Destination Host Unreachable
```

Which as you can probably now tell was a progress for me. Anyway, but I am kinda stuck here and don&#39;t know what to do. Here is how my ifconfig -a  looks like:

```
[user ~]% ifconfig -a 
eth0: flags=4163&lt;UP,BROADCAST,RUNNING,MULTICAST&gt;  mtu 1500
        inet 192.168.1.15  netmask 255.255.255.0  broadcast 192.168.1.255
        inet6 fe80::de2e:a11c:5001:d8b5  prefixlen 64  scopeid 0x20&lt;link&gt;

        TX packets 4962  bytes 323368 (315.7 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
        device interrupt 20  memory 0xf7300000-f7320000  

lo: flags=73&lt;UP,LOOPBACK,RUNNING&gt;  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        inet6 ::1  prefixlen 128  scopeid 0x10&lt;host&gt;
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 256733  bytes 553743564 (528.0 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 256733  bytes 553743564 (528.0 MiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0  collisions 0
```


Also I dont understand how to restart my network in Kicksecure, I tried:
```
sudo systemctl restart networking
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
/usr/bin/systemctl restart networking
sudo service networking restart
```
but nothing seems to worked, so I had to reboot my OS after yet another &quot;new brilliant idea&quot; that i had :) that what hell looks like xD especially with Luks encryption -.-


Please excuse me for all this emotional spam, I am tired, frustrated, I don&#39;t know what I am doing, but I am trying... well any tips where to keep digging would be much appreciated.

P.S @Patric, I am very sorry that you have to deal with dumb users like me :(</description>

            <p>Tested to be functional:</p>
<ul>
<li>A) LAN port;</li>
<li>B) USB LAN adapter</li>

<p>So that should work.</p>

            <p>I don’t know why this does not work out of the box for you but I can clear up some things.</p>
<p>There are various distinct software packages to configure networking on Linux. Some examples are ifupdown, Network Manager and systemd-networkd. “Usually” only 1 is installed by default and in use.</p>
<p>In case of Kicksecure, att time of writing, Kicksecure uses Network Manager by default.</p>
<p><a href="https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager" class="onebox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager</a></p>
<p>The networking related default installed packages are defined in this file: <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/kicksecure-network-conf/blob/master/debian/control" class="inline-onebox">kicksecure-network-conf/debian/control at master · Kicksecure/kicksecure-network-conf · GitHub</a></p>
<p>Package <code>kicksecure-network-conf</code> contains Kicksecure’s network related configurations.</p>

<p>Kicksecure at the time of writing does not install ifupdown by default. Therefore that files does not exist and creating it does nothing.</p>

</aside>
<p>A Debian specific (?) wrapper that works for both, sysvinit and systemd.</p>
<p>However, since Kicksecure at time of writing uses Network Manager the command would be:</p>
<pre><code>sudo service NetworkManager restart
</code></pre>
<p>Also using the Network Manager systray apples and/or using <code>nmcli</code> on the command line might be helpful.</p>
