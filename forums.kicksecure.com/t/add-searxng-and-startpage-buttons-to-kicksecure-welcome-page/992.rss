    <title>Add SearXNG and Startpage buttons to kicksecure-welcome-page</title>

    <description>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It&#39;s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, https://searchengine.party, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users&#39; IP.
Thank you for your work :heart:</description>

            <p>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It’s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, <a href="https://searchengine.party" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searchengine.party</a>, it is the most private and secure search engine.
