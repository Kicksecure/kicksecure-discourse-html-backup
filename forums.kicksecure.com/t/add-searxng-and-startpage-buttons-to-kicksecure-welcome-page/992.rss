    <title>Add SearXNG and Startpage buttons to kicksecure-welcome-page</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/add-searxng-and-startpage-buttons-to-kicksecure-welcome-page/992</link>
    <description>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It&#39;s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, https://searchengine.party, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users&#39; IP.
Thank you for your work :heart:</description>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This becomes rather difficult for me to follow. Discussing multiple search engines in 1 forum thread quickly gets confusing.</p>
<p>It <strong>might</strong> be the case that <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#Search_Engines_Criteria">Search Engines Criteria</a> are disregarded and search engines are only suggested to be promoted due to some other nice goal (such as being Open Source) while having no personal experiences with the search engine and while not personally using the search engine.</p>
<p>I cannot review 10s of search engines. There is limited space on the local browser welcome page. Therefore it needs to be based on criteria and popularity.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>please submit search engine related feature requests as per the following documentation / forum feature request template:</strong><br>
<strong><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Local_Browser_Homepage_-_Search_Engine_Feature_Request">Local Browser Homepage - Search Engine Feature Request</a></strong></p>
<p>No further action will be taken based on comments in this forum thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes, you are right. Startpage is a google clone that works well with Tor and VPN and does not attack users with captchas. They will ask you to change your Tor/VPN circuit if your IP is on many blacklists. But they will never block or slow down your search with a captcha.</p>

            <p>Patrick, I found several popular free open-source alternatives of Perplexity. These search engines work with TOR and have thousands of stars on github. You can consider this for adding to kicksecure and whonix welcome-page to increase the diversity of search results.</p>

<p>This link won’t be added to kicksecure-welcome-page because it’s only an overview page. It might be suitable somewhere in the wiki but no big focus needed at the kicksecure-welcome-page level.</p>

Even trusted projects like Debian and the Tor Project use services like AWS, Fastly, and CDNs. <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#cite_note-1">[1]</a> Most privacy claims by search engines are just “privacy by policy”, and key infrastructure remains hidden. That’s why trust is still needed. For comparison, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a> focuses on security by design and <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Whonix">Whonix</a> on anonymity by design.

</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not considered: Privacy wrappers</strong>: If a search engine only acts as a privacy wrapper, it’s not considered.</li>

<p>However, Startpage might be considered because:</p>

            <p>Hello. Your conclusion about the Startpage is interesting. Essentially, the Startpage is Google with a proxy, but also with a large amount of annoying ads. I think the value of this lies only in the proxy, as services like Searx or 4get.ca can replace it without displaying ads. However, I just conducted a test in Searx (Startpage only) and Startpage with the same query and settings, but the results were slightly different.</p>
<p>P.S. I was also surprised by the presence of Perplexity, and I thought they had fully open-sourced the code. Perhaps the presence of a non-open-source service will confuse those who will install Librewolf, Mullvad or Brave browsers in the future through the “Choose Browser” feature. But this raises the question - will Kicksecure-welcome-page be added to all browsers in the “Choose Browser” list?</p>

            <p>To rephrase… This is more of a practical consideration. Do you find yourself using that search engine because you find results that you don’t find on other search engines?</p>

            <p>Wow this is very interesting! I used Startpage because of the Tor browser - Tor browser has 2 default search engines: Duckduckgo and Startpage. I thought Tor team chose it for enhanced privacy and security. Startpage has been added to list of default search engines in the secure browsers Mullvad and Librewolf. And also, the guys from<br>
Privacy Guides <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tools/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ad-Free Privacy Tool/Service Recommendations - Privacy Guides</a> also recommend Startpage as a safe search engine after their analysis. And the author of searchengine.party put Startpage above Brave, Duckduckgo, and Qwant. It seems, Snowden gave an interview to Startpage and recommended their search engine in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124</a> I liked Startpage for search results and anonymous viewing. At same time your list includes proprietary Perplexity, although this is a very convenient service. for example, it seems to me that Startpage looks more secure than a proprietary service.<br>
As for SearXNG - choice of service is up to you. I just checked that Librewolf uses searx.be server. It seems that in this search engine you can configure search results output from Startpage and then SearXNG can be an alternative if you don’t like Startpage</p>

        <description><![CDATA[
            <p>SearXNG looks neat as a project, but simply “adding the SearXNG search engine” is tricky since SearXNG itself is an open-source project, not a service. Individuals may run public SearXNG services, but in that instance if you use those services, you are trusting whoever runs them with the info you’d be entrusting Google with if you use their search engine. SearXNG’s documentation even warns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always use an instance which is operated by people you trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the question then becomes what instance to trust. Personally I’m leery of personal instances because, well, we have no idea who’s running them. It could be a respectable privacy advocate who wants to do the world a favor, it might be the head of the intelligence agency of (insert a nation you dislike here). If an individual was very well-known in the open-source or privacy and security communities, and was able to sustainably run the search engine on their own, it would probably be fine, but otherwise, I’d steer clear there.</p>
<p>Company-run instances are a lot easier to trust ironically, because the entity behind them is known or at least more likely knowable. If they do something shady, it’s also more likely to become publicly known. The searchengine.party site linked by rico lists two company-run SearXNG instances, one run by /e/, and the other one ran by Disroot. Of the two, /e/ is known for <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/datenschutz-e-will-google-ersetzen-2004-147396-4.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">selling smartphones with an outdated and probably insecure version of Android, among other security failures</a>, so if I had to pick between them I’d <em>probably</em> trust Disroot a little more. Granted, I don’t necessarily think either of them are going to shuttle your data off to a large corporation, this is just my initial reaction looking at things.</p>
<p>My first impression of Startpage isn’t great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">their home page</a>, they claim to quote a few (presumably) high-profile people in the privacy space supporting them, including Edward Snowden, but with no links to the articles they’re (presumably) quoting.</li>
<li>They’re <a href="https://system1.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">owned by System1</a>, an advertising company that, in their own words, “<a href="https://system1.com/what-we-do" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">monetizes internet traffic by putting the right ads in front of the right people at the right time.</a>” This is obviously more than a little worrying.</li>
<li>Their search engine solution isn’t open-source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartpageSearch/comments/lge9n0/comment/gmtig3v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">at least partially because they’re using intentionally proprietary anti-spam algorithms</a>, which I guess is <em>reasonable</em> but still non-ideal.</li>
<li>On the plus side, I didn’t see any third-party analytics links when looking through the client-side source code of the home page, so that was good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately it seems like they’re making a bunch of claims you have to blindly trust, and some claims that, in a worst-case scenario, could technically be true while still leaving the platform privacy-invasive. (I.e., if they’re owned by an advertising company, they don’t exactly have to sell your data to monetize it. Just because they “block 3rd parties from accessing your personal data to target you”, doesn’t mean they can’t use your personal data to target you themselves.)</p>
<p>I took a look at the searchengine.party code, it looks reasonable at first glance, and the code deployed on the website itself is identical to the code from their <a href="https://gitlab.com/nitrohorse/search-engines-compare" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Git repository</a>. They were last updated ten months ago, which is a bit worrying, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/nitrohorse" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the maintainer hasn’t been very active on Gitlab this year</a>, so I’m not sure how well-maintained of a resource it is. Then again, it went a year and two months without an update and then received a bunch of updates ten months ago so maybe that’s just the speed at which it needs to be updated. Some way of automatically re-checking the various data points to ensure it’s accurate would be neat, not sure if that exists yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, in conclusion, I wouldn’t be opposed to adding Disroot’s SearXNG instance to the Kicksecure start page, and think that adding the searchengine.party page might be a good idea too. I don’t think adding Startpage is a good idea at the moment.</p>

            <p>Hello</p>
<p>Yes, please add Startpage button. I love Startpage and Kicksecure homepage. Its great to have arsenal of the best search engines on homepage - its faster and easier then bookmarks with different search engines. Many users hide bookmarks on startup tab.<br>
Homepage background is too bright and hurts eyes when launching browser in the evening or at night - at night want to close page faster to save eyes. Maybe elephant at sunset? And you can add ‘<em>functionality, reviews, cybersecurity manuals , solutions to known problems</em>’ to doc search. Kicksecure documentation and wiki are very cool - its more than just technical documentation. There is a lot of unique info about cybersecurity and privacy. New users will not only see in browser where to look for error solutions, but they will also want to learn more about cybersecurity - perhaps they will change their views on many topics, as happened to me. In various chats users often ask where they can read in detail about cybersecurity and I recommend Kicksecure / Whonix wiki. Patrick, you’ve done an excellent job!</p>

            <p>Yes, that would be a very convenient solution, since firefox esr does not have startpage search by default. And <a href="https://searx.space/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searx.space/</a> is also very useful. It is very convenient to have such buttons at hand when launching browser.</p>
<p>And maybe it would be worth changing elephant pic to a darker one so that buttons at top and  doc search are more contrasting and stand out better agains white clouds? Perhaps this way users will more often search for solutions to popular documented problems in documentation (visual memory will remember doc search on the homepage). Sorry if I am too picky about aesthetic. I love elephants and I greatly appreciate your fantastic work. All my friends are using Kicksecure now. Sometimes my friends (new users to Linux and Kicksecure) ask me about some problem. I tell them, “on browser’s homepage, there is a search for documentation, and it seems there is an instruction there to solve your problem”, and they respond “Yeah, right, I hadnt paid attention to this search before. It blends with background”</p>

            <p>Hello. I really like the idea of kicksecure-welcome-page. It’s very convenient to have buttons for different search engines. I think it would be excellent for convenience and privacy if you add the SearXNG search engine in the new update - according to many ratings, for example, <a href="https://searchengine.party" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://searchengine.party</a>, it is the most private and secure search engine. And it provides good search results. And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users’ IP.<br>
