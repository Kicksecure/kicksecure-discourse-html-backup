    <title>Guru Meditation VB - 37 ver not supported</title>

    <description>I looked up site:virtualbox.org for more information on this error message and all I could find was a ticket from several years ago about windows. My host is Fedora because Debian and Qubes are not fully hardware compatible with Intel Alder Lake.

Sometimes VirtualBox works perfectly, and then--spontaneously--it does not and says Guru Meditation is required. Oracle will not allow me to sign up for an account. I do not know why. If someone* can get a support request link or knows the answer, do so or please tell. 

(zip attached gzip - what part of the rest of the log is important?) . . . nope, forum doesn&#39;t allow zip format

            <p>Is there an EP for Fedora? I did not have KVM running when this happened or even installed the first* time it did.</p>
<ul>
<li>[footnote] It appears to happen spontaneously from my point of view when really there is a surreptitious cyber attack via compromised VPN or wireless side-channel, probably. I am not an inferior-PID. In 2030 China will be the world economic power (McCoy UW). USA will be secondary pid. China will probably also figure out how to spectrum dominance the neural net en masse with pulse microwave radiation like the US clandestine services do against veteran US citizens. Then the whole world will think America smokes pot and is poor. Congrats!</li>
