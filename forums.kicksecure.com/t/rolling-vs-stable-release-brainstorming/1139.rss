    <title>Rolling vs. Stable release brainstorming</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/rolling-vs-stable-release-brainstorming/1139</link>
    <description>Detailed overview of the issues with stable and rolling release distributions: https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Stable_vs_Rolling_Distributions

Kicksecure&#39;s current development strategy for the most part has been to harden Debian as much as is practically possible. This seems to have been working well for the most part, but there are some worries about the safety of some of the rather outdated software that Debian provides us. In particular:

* Critical, extremely complicated software like Firefox ESR and Thunderbird can sometimes get stuck with a known-vulnerable version in the latest version of Debian Stable for as long as a month.
* Software that isn&#39;t well-maintained may be left in a vulnerable state for long after the vulnerability is made public. (This happened with the zuluCrypt vulnerability discovered in Debian&#39;s zuluCrypt packaging a couple weeks ago or so.)
* Tangential to the above, bugs that aren&#39;t considered to be that big of a deal may not be fixed in a stable release of Debian ever. This isn&#39;t really a security issue necessarily, but it is a problem from a usability standpoint.

These things would be more-or-less resolved if Kicksecure was a rolling-release distro, for instance by rebasing our code onto a rolling-release variant of Debian (if one were to exist - we sort of almost have one with Debian Testing, but it doesn&#39;t quite serve the desired purpose perfectly). This however is not necessarily more secure:

* Rolling-release distros rolled out backdoored XZ code to end-users during the xz-utils attack. Thankfully (most of) those distros don&#39;t seem to have been targeted by the backdoor at all, but in principle a backdoored upstream or similar supply chain attack can have a much worse impact when using a rolling release.
* Rolling releases steadily introduce the latest bugs and vulnerabilities from upstream into the distro on a regular basis. (There isn&#39;t really any way around this, this isn&#39;t a criticism half so much of a statement of fact.) For software that isn&#39;t so complex as to be riddled with unknown vulnerabilities like web browsers, this is a potentially increased danger.
* Rolling releases can break a lot. An experienced user can go years or even over a decade without breaking a rolling release install beyond repair, but an inexperienced user can end up with a broken system within a few weeks if they accidentally do something like upgrade their system without checking what packages will be removed in the process. (I&#39;d like to think I&#39;m an experienced user, and I&#39;ve nuked Debian Sid virtual machines multiple times doing this. Not fun.)

It might be possible to combine the advantages of both stable and rolling releases, by keeping Kicksecure&#39;s stable base, but offering &quot;rolling&quot; versions of specific packages like web browsers, email clients, (maybe?) media viewers, etc. Anything that has to handle highly complex untrusted data would be a good candidate for this sort of thing, especially software with a rapid-release cycle. We&#39;re already moving in this direction to some decree with [Browser Choice](), which is in active development.

What are everyone&#39;s thoughts on the above? Where could our docs use improvement? Are there ideas for how to get the best of both worlds (rolling and stable) other than just a stable base with specific rolling apps? What are some other apps we should probably think about making rolling or recommending that people install rolling versions of if they use those apps? Are there potential pitfalls we need to avoid with rolling apps? (On this last point, we probably should not do what KDE neon did to try to make the Qt and KDE stacks rolling on top of base Ubuntu - that way of doing things kept breaking things for people alarmingly frequently.)</description>

<p>Quote <a href="https://security-team.debian.org/security_tracker.html" class="inline-onebox">Debian Security Team</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vulnerabilities without an assigned CVE id</p>
<p>If you learn of a vulnerability to which no CVE id has been assigned yet, you can request one. In the meantime, you can add an entry of the form</p>
<p>CVE-2009-XXXX [optipng array overflow]<br>
- optipng 0.6.2.1-1 (low)<br>
NOTE: <a href="https://secunia.com/advisories/34035/" class="inline-onebox">About Secunia Research | Flexera</a></p>
<p>It is desirable to include references which uniquely identify the issue, such as a permanent link to an entry in the upstream bug tracker, or a bug in the Debian BTS. If the issue is likely present in unstable, a bug should be filed to help the maintainer to track it.</p>
<p>Lack of CVE entries should not block advisory publication which are otherwise ready, but we should strive to release fully cross-referenced advisories nevertheless.</p>

</aside>
<p>wha… ok, excuse me for a moment, but this CVE is just patently ridiculous. Since when is it a software security vulnerability if a randomly flipped bit in RAM can cause a bypass? If the hardware fails or behaves in a completely unexpected way, that is firmly the hardware’s fault. I am not about to, and I expect no one else to, start programming effectively <a href="https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/57257/radiation-hardened-quine" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">radiation-hardened software</a> because of RowHammer, unless that is explicitly marked as my job. Either an OS-level mitigation or a hardware replacement needs to be responsible for this. The solution to RowHammer is not to make software resistant to bit flips, it’s to keep the bits from flipping in the first place.</p>
<p>(sorry for the rant, you do have a decent point in general, just this particular CVE is crazy.)</p>

<p>True, true, true, but thats the maximum you can have. Keep improving these areas because there is no better way exist. These solutions are not the 100% but nothing exist better than them specially when you have shattered apps/code developed by different people, different languages used, developers doesnt always follow instructions or steps of best practices…etc, so to somewhat control this mess there isnt in my knowledge better ways to handle that rather than the suggestions i posted.</p>

<p>Sandboxing is great, but also not a magic bullet fixing all issues, even if functional.</p>
<p>In case of SSH:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1) vulnerability “regreSSHion”</li>
<li>(2) malicious backdoor “xz backdoor”</li>
</ul>
<p>sandboxing did not help. SSH is sandboxed.</p>
<p>SSH is very popular and its security very important. Therefore unsurprisnig, sandboxing has already been implemented.<br>
(<a href="https://jfrog.com/blog/examining-openssh-sandboxing-and-privilege-separation-attack-surface-analysis/" class="inline-onebox">OpenSSH Privilege Separation and Sandbox - Attack Surface Analysis</a>)</p>
<p>Sandboxing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sandboxing protects the system from the application.</li>
<li>Sandbox can prevent exploitation of some types of vulnerabilities. (Such as when using a seccomp sandbox and any exploitation attempt requiring a disallowed seccomp syscall.)</li>
<li>Sandboxing (at least upstream/distribution default sandboxing) cannot prevent backdoor exploitation. For example, I don’t see how any sandboxing could have stopped the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Backdoor#Bitpay_Wallet_Malicious_Backdoor">Bitpay Wallet Malicious Backdoor</a>.</li>

<p>Bottom line is that the software you are using either good or a mess, and this is only to blame the upstream developer with. on the edge fixes of features and vulnerability is better than sitting old and dirty waiting for fixes (which some released for years already).</p>

<p>This is a very valid argument (more-or-less the same one I’m making) for some software like Firefox. But for, say, SSH, do I really want to always pull in the latest shiny new thing, complete with new vulns like regreSSHion? Probably not. The codebase doesn’t move nearly as fast, and so it’s practical to just backport fixes as necessary.</p>

Let alone how many bugs or vulnerabilities got fixed without debian (or any stable) got notified with (until its too late).</p>

<p>Yep this is the reality but how this point is not against stable as well? because what is stable? stable software (specially in debian context) is a bunch of code which likely still have vulnerabilities/bugs frozen at certain state. So is having stable prevent security issues? no. prevent bugs? no. actually it introduces a new dilemma which is frozen software with bugs (graphical or so) will not be fixed even if its fixed upstream.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that the software you are using either good or a mess, and this is only to blame the upstream developer with. on the edge fixes of features and vulnerability is better than sitting old and dirty waiting for fixes (which some released for years already).</p>
<p>Note about Debian: Debian even modify the software and makes it act stupidly/introduce new bug that the upstream of the package has no idea why its doing what is doing e.g <a href="https://gitlab.com/libvirt/libvirt/-/issues/406#note_1176654618">KVM + Debian with nftable</a> (debian modified it to worse/backward solely for its own desire).</p>

<p>Stable base system with rolling software for the user is the industry level technology (Android, IOS, Almost Windows…), even Fedora and Opensuse went into this direction.</p>

</aside>
<p>Probably having a microkernel + native apps like harmonyos, but this isnt achievable by small development circle or community or hobbyists.</p>
<p>(Although even with this design, separating base from user apps can still give better security specially if they are in VM)</p>

            <p>Detailed overview of the issues with stable and rolling release distributions: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/Stable_vs_Rolling_Distributions" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Stable vs Rolling Distributions - Security Analysis</a></p>
<p>Kicksecure’s current development strategy for the most part has been to harden Debian as much as is practically possible. This seems to have been working well for the most part, but there are some worries about the safety of some of the rather outdated software that Debian provides us. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Critical, extremely complicated software like Firefox ESR and Thunderbird can sometimes get stuck with a known-vulnerable version in the latest version of Debian Stable for as long as a month.</li>
<li>Software that isn’t well-maintained may be left in a vulnerable state for long after the vulnerability is made public. (This happened with the zuluCrypt vulnerability discovered in Debian’s zuluCrypt packaging a couple weeks ago or so.)</li>
<li>Tangential to the above, bugs that aren’t considered to be that big of a deal may not be fixed in a stable release of Debian ever. This isn’t really a security issue necessarily, but it is a problem from a usability standpoint.</li>
</ul>
<p>These things would be more-or-less resolved if Kicksecure was a rolling-release distro, for instance by rebasing our code onto a rolling-release variant of Debian (if one were to exist - we sort of almost have one with Debian Testing, but it doesn’t quite serve the desired purpose perfectly). This however is not necessarily more secure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rolling-release distros rolled out backdoored XZ code to end-users during the xz-utils attack. Thankfully (most of) those distros don’t seem to have been targeted by the backdoor at all, but in principle a backdoored upstream or similar supply chain attack can have a much worse impact when using a rolling release.</li>
<li>Rolling releases steadily introduce the latest bugs and vulnerabilities from upstream into the distro on a regular basis. (There isn’t really any way around this, this isn’t a criticism half so much of a statement of fact.) For software that isn’t so complex as to be riddled with unknown vulnerabilities like web browsers, this is a potentially increased danger.</li>
<li>Rolling releases can break a lot. An experienced user can go years or even over a decade without breaking a rolling release install beyond repair, but an inexperienced user can end up with a broken system within a few weeks if they accidentally do something like upgrade their system without checking what packages will be removed in the process. (I’d like to think I’m an experienced user, and I’ve nuked Debian Sid virtual machines multiple times doing this. Not fun.)</li>
</ul>
<p>It might be possible to combine the advantages of both stable and rolling releases, by keeping Kicksecure’s stable base, but offering “rolling” versions of specific packages like web browsers, email clients, (maybe?) media viewers, etc. Anything that has to handle highly complex untrusted data would be a good candidate for this sort of thing, especially software with a rapid-release cycle. We’re already moving in this direction to some decree with <a>Browser Choice</a>, which is in active development.</p>
<p>What are everyone’s thoughts on the above? Where could our docs use improvement? Are there ideas for how to get the best of both worlds (rolling and stable) other than just a stable base with specific rolling apps? What are some other apps we should probably think about making rolling or recommending that people install rolling versions of if they use those apps? Are there potential pitfalls we need to avoid with rolling apps? (On this last point, we probably should not do what KDE neon did to try to make the Qt and KDE stacks rolling on top of base Ubuntu - that way of doing things kept breaking things for people alarmingly frequently.)</p>
