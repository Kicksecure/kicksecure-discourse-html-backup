    <title>Grub Live vs toram?</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/grub-live-vs-toram/1391</link>
    <description>Hello Kicksecure,

Been a long time lurker since I started using whonix and really like debian and all that jazz.

So my question is whats the difference between grub live and a custom grub entry with `toram noswap nohibernate` flags?

Whats different with “grub live” or makes it different from a custom entry that has `toram noswap nohibernate` chosen and passed after selecting it in the bootloader?

Previously I installed grub-live on debian through the Kicksecure repo in the past out of curiosity it said I had swap enabled still which also confuses it me? That was like many months ago so I’m sure things have changed?

Is it some kind of compression swap like overlay like zram?</description>

<p>grub-live mode mounts the root filesystem read-only, and uses one or more writable tmpfs filesystems (which exist purely in RAM) to store file changes. On the other hand, <code>toram</code> copies an ISO live filesystem into RAM entirely, so that you don’t need the boot media plugged in anymore for the system to remain running.</p>
<p>(Note that <code>toram</code> appears to be specific to live-tools and initramfs-tools. Kicksecure uses Dracut for initramfs management; the corresponding feature in Dracut appears to be <code>rd.live.ram=1</code>. I wouldn’t expect this to work with an installed Kicksecure system, but it might work on the ISO. Untested.)</p>
