    <title>Kicksecure Installer Settings (17.4.4.6 Feedback)</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/kicksecure-installer-settings-17-4-4-6-feedback/1457</link>
    <description>I’d like to break my feedback into separate posts, each covering a single topic, to keep things clear. First, I have to say I’m genuinely impressed with Kicksecure. Over the years I’ve written countless post install scripts just to harden a vanilla Debian installation. Despite trying several distributions, I always end up back at Debian. Only to be frustrated by its insecure defaults and the tedious manual hardening required. Literally editing config files till I go crazy lol. Kicksecure feels refreshingly different, the defaults are already security focused, which is fantastic. Kudos to the developers and the community!

### Installation Details

---

Version:           Kicksecure 17.4.4.6

Install medium:    Sandisk USB

Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted)

---

I flashed the ISO to one USB stick, then used a second USB as the target for the installation (for testing purposes).

* Missing “Etc/UTC” Timezone Option

Under timezone there is no `Etc/UTC` which I really wanted to set and had to set after post install `timedatectl set-timezone &quot;Etc/UTC&quot;`. This isn’t really Kicksecures fault but a Calamares configuration issue. I believe this timezone is omitted or ignored in the default installer but I haven’t digged enough yet to see.

* Can’t show LUKS password (LUKS Password Visibility)

Again, this is an installer side matter rather than a Kicksecure problem. While many installers (e.g., Ubuntu) let you toggle password visibility for user accounts, the Calamares stage that collects the LUKS passphrase lacks such a toggle. In a previous Debian install, long some time ago I entered the wrong LUKS password. I had to reinstall cause I was off on the keys I set for the LUKS password at this stage.

Is there a way to expose a “show password” option for the LUKS field in the Calamares configuration? If not, perhaps this could be proposed upstream to libkpmcore?</description>

<p>FYI, Kicksecure 18 is out and 17 will likely be deprecated soon. If you have the time, you might want to give it a shot, it has a lot of neat security improvements over version 17 (like Wayland by default and a “panic button” for instant shutdown).</p>

</aside>
<p>Using <code>Etc/UTC</code> as a timezone is more of an anonymity measure than a security one, and we generally keep the anonymity enhancements in Whonix. That being said, this does still sound like a useful feature, maybe you could file a request for this at <a href="https://codeberg.org/Calamares/calamares/issues">https://codeberg.org/Calamares/calamares/issues</a>?</p>

<p>That would also be a good thing to file a feature request for. Doesn’t look like the feature exists at first glance.</p>
