    <title>Scira AI instead of Perplexity</title>
    <link>https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/scira-ai-instead-of-perplexity/1034</link>
    <description>In another chat, we discussed adding search engines and touched on the topic of Perplexity. I propose considering replacing Perplexity with Scira AI on kicksecure-welcome-page for the following reasons:

More functionality: Unlike Perplexity, Scira has more modes - 7 compared to 3 - and you can choose between chat only or internet overview only.

Convenience: No registration required, no window asking to register during use, free.

User safety: Scira informs about the absence of cryptocurrency and tokens and asks not to fall for any potential scams in its name on the internet

Open source: This is not a criterion for a search engine, but it aligns with the Freedom Values published on the Kicksecure website

Works with Tor/VPN without Captcha: Perplexity does not work with Tor and often asks to complete a Captcha for some locations with NordVPN and Mullvad VPN
