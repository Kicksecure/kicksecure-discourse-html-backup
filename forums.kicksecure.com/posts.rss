        <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Did a lot of research into this, the approach I was taking technically worked but was not at all guaranteed to work. The issues (and how to work around them) I documented pretty well in a code comment in the program I’m currently writing to implement this:</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="c"><code class="lang-c">/*
 * This program is designed specifically to immediately and forcibly power off
 * the system in the event the device providing the root filesystem is
 * abruptly removed from the system. The idea is that a user can shut down
 * a portable installation of Kicksecure by simply yanking the USB drive
 * containing the installation from the computer. Tails provides essentially
 * the same feature, however it is known for occasionally failing to do its
 * job properly.
 *
 * The fact that we're triggering a shutdown when the device containing the
 * root filesystem vanishes presents a number of significant challenges:
 *
 * - The device providing the entire operating system is gone. The only things
 *   we will still have left are the kernel, files loaded into RAM (for
 *   instance under /run), and anything that happens to still be in the
 *   system's disk cache.
 * - Virtually any process on the system may abruptly crash at any time. This
 *   isn't just because applications may be unable to access files. The Linux
 *   kernel's virtual memory subsystem doesn't just page out RAM contents to a
 *   swap file, it will sometimes simply erase pages containing executable
 *   code from memory if it can reload that code from disk later when needed.
 *   If part of a program isn't present in memory, and then the root device
 *   vanishes, any attempt to use code in the absent part of the application
 *   will result in the application crashing. (Attempts to access data in RAM
 *   that happened to be paged out will result in a similar crash.)
 * - We have no control over what is and isn't in the disk cache, which makes
 *   it unsafe to launch any dynamically linked executable. What happens if we
 *   need to load a missing part of libc? What if the dynamic linker itself
 *   needs loaded from disk?
 * - Systemd could lock up at any time, since the init process isn't immune to
 *   having bits of it erased from RAM to free up memory. If systemd receives
 *   a SIGSEGV, rather than crashing (which would panic the kernel), it goes
 *   into an "emergency mode" that tries to keep the system as operational as
 *   possible even though PID 1 is now out of service.
 *
 * Circumventing this set of difficulties is not easy, and it might not even
 * be entirely possible. To give our feature the highest chance of success:
 *
 * - We use memlockd to lock systemd into memory. It can holds its own pretty
 *   well in the event of a segfault, but if its crash handler ends up
 *   re-segfaulting, that could get ugly. For good measure, we lock libc,
 *   libsystemd-core, and libsystemd-shared into memory too so that the crash
 *   handler has the highest possible chance of not re-crashing.
 * - We compile the utility at boot time, statically link it against all of
 *   its dependencies (really only one, glibc), and load it into /run. This
 *   allows for decent architecture independence while removing any dependency
 *   on anything that isn't in RAM, thus (hopefully!) making the process
 *   crash-immune.
 * - Because we're static-linking against glibc, we cannot call anything
 *   defined in stdio.h. This is because glibc uses dlopen() to load iconv
 *   modules, which are used internally by glibc for locale support. Things
 *   defined in stdio.h may use iconv, so calling anything there will
 *   basically make our static-linked executable become dynamically linked,
 *   which could segfault it since the root filesystem is gone. We can't call
 *   anything that could touch Name Service Switch (NSS) either, but we have
 *   no need to do so, so we should be safe there. See
 *   https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57476533/why-is-statically-linking-glibc-discouraged
 * - We can't use udev either because libudev is only available as a dynamic
 *   library. That means we have to listen to kernel uevents directly to
 *   determine when the root device vanishes. Thankfully this isn't as much of
 *   a pain as it might sound like.
 * - We don't call out to any external process, since those external processes
 *   could segfault.
 *
 * This is likely superior to Tails' implementation, which uses udev (and thus
 * dynamic linking), uses an interpreter-driven script to shut down the system
 * when the root device vanishes, and calls out to external executables to
 * actually shut the system down. These issues are likely why Tails'
 * implementation of emergency shutdown occasionally fails. See
 * https://www.reddit.com/r/tails/comments/xh8njn/tails_wont_shutdown_when_i_pull_usb_stick/
 * (there are other similar posts as well).
 */
</code></pre>
<p>The rest of my research was focused mainly on figuring out how to read kernel uevents without involving libudev. This took a while, partially because libudev itself was sticking its head in the way and confusing my program’s output, and partially because <code>man 7 netlink</code> was extraordinarily misleading (it told me the data from the kernel I was reading was going to be in one format, it turned out to be in a completely different format). However, I’ve gotten to the point where I <em>can</em> read kernel uevents, which will let me detect when the root filesystem drive is removed without needing any other libraries or executables (which is important for the reasons described above).</p>
<p>Once this is done and working, it might be worth trying to contribute it back to Tails (or at least let them know about our work) so they can improve their implementation as well.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This becomes rather difficult for me to follow. Discussing multiple search engines in 1 forum thread quickly gets confusing.</p>
<p>It <strong>might</strong> be the case that <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#Search_Engines_Criteria">Search Engines Criteria</a> are disregarded and search engines are only suggested to be promoted due to some other nice goal (such as being Open Source) while having no personal experiences with the search engine and while not personally using the search engine.</p>
<p>I cannot review 10s of search engines. There is limited space on the local browser welcome page. Therefore it needs to be based on criteria and popularity.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>please submit search engine related feature requests as per the following documentation / forum feature request template:</strong><br>
<strong><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Local_Browser_Homepage_-_Search_Engine_Feature_Request">Local Browser Homepage - Search Engine Feature Request</a></strong></p>
<p>No further action will be taken based on comments in this forum thread.</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>Yes, you are right. Startpage is a google clone that works well with Tor and VPN and does not attack users with captchas. They will ask you to change your Tor/VPN circuit if your IP is on many blacklists. But they will never block or slow down your search with a captcha.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>On the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency">Project Transparency</a> wiki page, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#Search_Engines_Criteria">Search Engines Criteria</a> have been formalized just now.</p>

<p>disroot SearXNG</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to the street fight vibe on it’s homepage, it won’t be added due the the now formalized criteria:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Needs to be relatively POLITICALLY AGNOSTIC</strong>: Some search engines may show a strong political bias. This project aims to stay politically neutral to be inclusive and avoid pushing any agenda. The focus is on security and privacy. That’s why strongly biased politically search engines are avoided.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://searchengine.party/">https://searchengine.party/</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This link won’t be added to kicksecure-welcome-page because it’s only an overview page. It might be suitable somewhere in the wiki but no big focus needed at the kicksecure-welcome-page level.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://searx.space/">https://searx.space/</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>And you can also add the popular search engine Startpage, which can hide users’ IP.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Privacy wrappers will not be considered.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not considered: Privacy by policy / ownership / location / hosted by which data center</strong>: These factors are not considered. Even trusted projects like Debian and the Tor Project use services like AWS, Fastly, and CDNs. <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#cite_note-1">[1]</a> Most privacy claims by search engines are just “privacy by policy”, and key infrastructure remains hidden. That’s why trust is still needed. For comparison, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a> focuses on security by design and <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Whonix">Whonix</a> on anonymity by design. Anything based only on policy is out of scope.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not considered: Privacy wrappers</strong>: If a search engine only acts as a privacy wrapper, it’s not considered.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>However, Startpage might be considered because:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Less captcha wrappers</strong>: Some search engines bombard users with captchas or block them completely if their network is flagged (for example, Tor users, VPN users, or even some normal internet connections).

        <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Won’t be able to finish this tonight, determining the block device that’s <em>actually</em> underneath the filesystem is a bit of a challenge. One of the comments I wrote in my current code reads:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    # ... the real underlying device may be many
    # layers deep. For instance, with the Kicksecure ISO, the root filesystem
    # is mounted from an overlayfs which uses a lower directory mounted from a
    # loop device backed by a squashfs located in a directory under a
    # mountpoint backed by /dev/sr0 (when booting from a CD-ROM drive that
    # is).
</code></pre>
<p>There’s also some higher-priority work for me to tackle before I finish this. I have most of the research done though, including how to find underlying devices or mountpoints in a wide variety of situations, and how to monitor the real device once you find it. Also wrote a rather thorough “force shutdown” script based partially on <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/maltfield">@maltfield</a>’s suggestions above.</p> ]]></description>

This security enhancement separates daily user activities from system maintenance tasks. The regular user account can no longer use sudo, su, or pkexec by default. Instead, administrative rights are reserved for a dedicated system maintenance account (sysmaint), reducing security risk…

R4.2
R4.3

### Brief summary

Kicksecure; and Qubes-Whonix<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> Templates are built for Qubes stable version (R4.2 at time of writing) only by me.

### Steps to reproduce

n/a

### Expected behavior

Some people may expect the Templates to also be available for Qubes development version (R4.3 at time of writing).

In response to my [announcement of availability of Qubes Kicksecure Template for testers](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/kicksecure-17-template/31893/11), @alimirjamali said:

&gt; Would it be possible to trigger a template build for r4.3 as well? For testing users who are on R4.3 alpha.

### Actual behavior

Templates are built for Qubes stable version only.

### Additional information

Why not simply always build for stable and development version of Qubes? I don't know if there are computational and/or storage restraints by Qubes build servers.

related:

* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9573

### Desired outcome of this ticket

A Qubes core team member expressing the policy. Potential replies:

* &gt; No problem, it is OK and wanted to always build Templates for Qubes stable and Qubes development version.
* &gt; Qubes development Templates should be built on demand or when deemed necessary, but some sort of restraint would be desirable to save disk space.

### Potential outcome

I'd modify [dm-qubes-templates-official-build-commands](https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-qubes-templates-official-build-commands) to add either a reminder or automation to build Templates also for Qubes development version.</span></p>

        <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This is definitely a good idea. I took a look at the linked video about BusKill, the idea seems good but I don’t think that’s the method we should use for Kicksecure, because it’s bound to the USB product ID. You have to custom-write the udev rule for the specific USB drive in use. We could in theory detect this on boot I guess, but that seems a bit clunky. I also don’t trust USB drive manufacturers to choose truly unique IDs, as opposed to just putting in some example ID they found in documentation somewhere. (If even AMD can make this mistake with encryption keys related to microcode security, I have no reason to trust off-brand USB drive makers to do any better.) The last thing a user needs is to have their system suddenly shut down because they removed a drive that happened to look suspiciously similar to the main drive.</p>
<p>I looked at how Tails has this implemented, and basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a custom C executable, <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/src/udev-watchdog.c" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">udev-watchdog</a>, which appears to watch for a specified device to be removed and send some sort of signal to whatever called it when that happens.</li>
<li>There’s then a wrapper around it that figures out which device is the boot drive, uses udev-watchdog to watch for when it gets removed, and then triggers a hard shutdown when that happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a somewhat better solution IMO, and the code behind it is open-source so in theory we could just integrate it directly into Kicksecure. It does have some possible downsides though, most notably I found some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tails/comments/xh8njn/tails_wont_shutdown_when_i_pull_usb_stick/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">reports that the feature didn’t always work three years ago</a>, when the last code change <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/udev-watchdog-wrapper" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">was four years ago</a>. Maybe that was just user error though.</p>
<p>For Kicksecure’s implementation, I’d like to avoid custom C code since Kicksecure tries to use architecture-independent code wherever possible. We can use a udev-based approach similar to Tails, but written using Python and pyudev instead. I’ll try to implement this probably tonight and see what happens.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello. Your conclusion about the Startpage is interesting. Essentially, the Startpage is Google with a proxy, but also with a large amount of annoying ads. I think the value of this lies only in the proxy, as services like Searx or 4get.ca can replace it without displaying ads. However, I just conducted a test in Searx (Startpage only) and Startpage with the same query and settings, but the results were slightly different.</p>
<p>P.S. I was also surprised by the presence of Perplexity, and I thought they had fully open-sourced the code. Perhaps the presence of a non-open-source service will confuse those who will install Librewolf, Mullvad or Brave browsers in the future through the “Choose Browser” feature. But this raises the question - will Kicksecure-welcome-page be added to all browsers in the “Choose Browser” list?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think it’s unnecessary and not worth spending time on it. If you’re going to add new buttons to the panel (such as a journal search, system monitor, firewall…), then the panel will increase in size and will overlap any background.<br>
By the way, have you considered changing the color for Livecheck on the panel: green for live, and yellow/orange/red for persistent mode, to warn users that everything they do will be saved to the system, in order to increase the level of responsibility. When clicking on the circle, you can add a hint “if you’re not sure about your actions, test it in live mode”.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Wow this is very interesting! I used Startpage because of the Tor browser - Tor browser has 2 default search engines: Duckduckgo and Startpage. I thought Tor team chose it for enhanced privacy and security. Startpage has been added to list of default search engines in the secure browsers Mullvad and Librewolf. And also, the guys from<br>
Privacy Guides <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tools/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ad-Free Privacy Tool/Service Recommendations - Privacy Guides</a> also recommend Startpage as a safe search engine after their analysis. And the author of searchengine.party put Startpage above Brave, Duckduckgo, and Qwant. It seems, Snowden gave an interview to Startpage and recommended their search engine in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124</a> I liked Startpage for search results and anonymous viewing. At same time your list includes proprietary Perplexity, although this is a very convenient service. for example, it seems to me that Startpage looks more secure than a proprietary service.<br>
As for SearXNG - choice of service is up to you. I just checked that Librewolf uses searx.be server. It seems that in this search engine you can configure search results output from Startpage and then SearXNG can be an alternative if you don’t like Startpage</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thinking about it more, I think even if we do want to implement some form of background customization for sysmaint sessions, it should be rather limited (i.e., we shouldn’t allow making an arbitrary image the desktop background). Reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting an image into the sysmaint account is unsafe almost no matter how you do it:
<ul>
<li>You could launch Firefox and download an image, but the web browser offers a substantial amount of attack surface. One of the main reasons for creating <code>sysmaint-panel</code> in the first place was to discourage the user from launching Firefox in a sysmaint session.</li>
<li>You could download an image into <code>/home/user/Downloads</code> and then copy it into the <code>sysmaint</code> account in a sysmaint session, but that’s tricky due to user account separations in Kicksecure, and you’re still trusting an arbitrary image from a user account that may be compromised. (Obviously you don’t want your <code>user</code> account compromised, but we try to assume it and other user accounts <em>are</em> compromised and design the sysmaint session accordingly.)</li>
<li>You could overcome the clunkiness of having to copy files into the <code>sysmaint</code> account by making there be some way to change the <code>sysmaint</code> account’s background from a user session, but that’s even worse from a security standpoint because now the <code>user</code> account can push arbitrary images into the <code>sysmaint</code> account at will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Image files are a well-known exploit vector due to the complexity of most common image file formats. There probably are zero-days in the image file parsing code used by Qt, if history is any indicator. Therefore image files aren’t something you want to just blindly trust if you can help it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, implementing some form of background customization might be neat, but I’d want to limit it to setting a solid color or gradient background. Currently the background you see in a sysmaint session isn’t an image at all, it’s created on the fly with a Qt CSS theming trick. Allowing the user to choose the start and end colors of the gradient would allow some customization without any of the dangers of images. I’m not sure if that’s something <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> is interested in at the moment, but that’s a theoretical way of doing this.</p> ]]></description>
