<p>That sounds like the drives you’re using are so slow that the default timeout value isn’t long enough; I’ve seen these errors when installing to some USB 3 TeamGroup drives in the past. Many USB flash drives have decent read speed but horrible write speed, even USB 3 drives.</p>
<p>The <em>good</em> solution would be to use faster drives, but if you need to use the drives you have, you can lengthen the timeout:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot the live ISO, and select <code>LIVE Mode | SYSMAINT Session | system maintenance, install</code>.</li>
<li>Click <code>Open Terminal</code>.</li>
<li>Run <code>sudo nano /usr/lib/calamares/modules/bootloader-config/module.desc</code>.</li>
<li>Adjust the <code>timeout:     600</code> line to something longer, like <code>timeout:     5000</code>.</li>
<li>Save with Ctrl+S, exit with Ctrl+X.</li>
<li>Close the terminal window.</li>
<li>Click <code>Install System</code>.</li>
<li>Install like normal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because USB installations like you’re doing are explicitly supported, and USB drives are so frequently slow, we should probably lengthen some of these timeouts.</p>

<p>This sounds like Rufus is buggy to me. That message is most likely from GRUB. Etcher exists and probably would work better, but I didn’t mention it since like you mentioned, it does phone home. I don’t know of any other good ISO burning tools for Windows unfortunately. Thankfully, it looks like <code>dd</code> in Linux is doing the trick, so hopefully you won’t need to use Windows for this sort of thing <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p> ]]></description>

        <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I thought I was getting somewhere by finding a portable vers. of a prog. to run in Tails, but they are dead-set against Internet access in it outside of Tor.  A supposed method to allow it in a vid on YT, no longer works.  I did take the opportunity to burn a Live disk in Linux from it, using the dd command above.  It burnt a LOT faster than in Rufus.</p>
<p>The first time I tried to install Kicksecure in it, it worked!  This was even burning onto one of the SeaGlass drives I’d had probs. with before.  Kicksecure looks very promising, IF there’s a way to disable Tor and/or allow third-party apps internet access.  With a presumably good Live disk on a USB, and full of something (perhaps enthusiasm?), I proceeded to spend lots of time trying to install it to other USB drives.  It failed on two yet different 32 GB SeaGlass drives, and to make it complete, it failed to install on the original ancient SanDisk it originally worked on.  <strong>That makes it four fresh tries, using the Live ISO burnt with with dd: One of them a success, and three more failures - including a non-Verbatim drive which had previously worked.</strong>  In each failure this time, and most of the previous ones, it gave the error about bootloader_config not finishing after 600 secs.  Failures occurred burning from at least two different USB drives that had worked for the Live ISO on other occasions.</p>
<p>This seems like an uninitialized variable problem in the installation from the Live disk; or a timing problem.  It manifested if I booted up the Live USB with the GUID partition entry, or with its USB boot menu entry.  It looks like the problem isn’t Rufus, nor is it the SeaGlass drives.  One of the SeaGlass drives had been triggered to go into a Read-Only mode.  I couldn’t even format it until I went into Windows and did “DISKPART”.  I navigated to the drive, and did “CLEAN”.  This erases it, but makes it it writable.  I think you have a problem in your “bootloader_config” script, causing installing it to be a mostly hit or miss process (mostly miss).  It looks quite nice, from the two times the installer completed successfully..</p> ]]></description>

<p>Documentation states its been around for awhile, and dont think its depreciated or changed in new kernels. I know this topic is about hibernation and I don’t want change topics but might be something to look at here.</p>
<p>The wiki states that <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live#cite_ref-12" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“There is no swap partition by default in Kicksecure, except maybe if using Distribution Morphing.”</a> already but since some people distro morph. Then if a user has swap or encrypted swap this would just be a pro not a con to my understanding it could or would help add more defense to avoid persistence.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I decided to try using the drives that had worked previously again.  If I installed in dd mode, the created disk wouldn’t launch the maint menu item.  If I installed in ISO mode, I had two boot choices in the BIOS: USB &amp; GPT.  The USB choice resulted in “542: Index out of bounds” in a console window; but no maint mode.  I finally got the live disk to boot with Rufus only if burned as an ISO, and booted from it’s GPT boot entry.  Using the same ISO, and the same drives that previously had worked with Rufus, I was unable to recreate my initial success.  Burnt as an ISO, they all had errors about not being able to config the bootloader, which had timed out after 600 secs., not being able to run config_bootloader, or index out of bounds.  It ultimately failed on the hardware it previously worked on.</p>
<p>It looked very nice, the time it did work.  It seemed like just the thing I needed, the one time it did work.  It may take a while for me to install a Linux and give it a try there.  The point is, however, the problem was intermittent, and extended to all the thumb drives I tried it on.  It may well turn out that Rufus might turn out to be the problem, and just doesn’t burn it right.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Further tests have shown that when I burn in DD mode in Rufus, I get a working Live setup on the original thumb drive that worked.  I burnt it to a thumb drive that worked for the ISO previously.  When I try install to HD on the other thumb drive, no matter if it’s the drive that worked originally or not, I get errors such as 'The bootloader could not be installed.; or ‘Failed to execute command /bootloader-config.’  It originally worked when burning it as an ISO.  I’m interested to find out the prob. now.  I will try it a little more before trying the “dd” command from Linux.  (I instolled PI-OS, and then switched to Technecium,  and have been meaning to get around to installing NixOS for the WSL Linux.)</p> ]]></description>

<p>It’s worth a try.  Still, the USB drive it runs on shouldn’t make the difference, IMHO.  I’m not saying it’s not compatible with Linux, but rather that hardware was the only difference between the drives I created that did work, and that didn’t work..</p>

<p>I burnt an ISO onto a thumbdrive.  I did not unpack it.  Next, I left in the live disk, and added a blank one.  I installed Kicksecure onto the empty thumb drive.  I don’t see where I unpacked anything.</p>
<p>Thx for some great things to try, BTW.</p>

<p>This question mentioned the use of DD is addressed here:</p>

<p>It says it has changed, so that you only get the option if it’s a hybrid ISO.  Burning again, I do get the question.  Perhaps I chose it one time, and didn’t another, heh.</p>
<p>I do remember that the Tails instructions have a notice there that said Balena Etcher used to be their recommended burner, as the KickSecure instructions still do; but that the app was found to be phoning home.  If memory serves, they are now recommending Rufus.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Generally, USB drives themselves act like any other drive under Linux; it’s theoretically possible a drive <em>could</em> be compatible with Windows and not Linux, but in practice I have never seen this be the case.</p>
<p>You’re using Rufus to burn the ISO to the drives. Rufus might not install Kicksecure to a USB drive properly; the ISO is designed to be written <em>directly</em> to a disk, not unpacked into a filesystem on the disk. If you must use Rufus, try using “dd mode” to write the ISO. Better yet, use an existing Linux installation and flash the ISO using <code>dd</code>, i.e. <code>sudo dd if=./kicksecure.iso of=/dev/sdX bs=4M</code>.</p>
<p>(There is, of course, always the possibility that the drives themselves are failing. Drives are most likely to fail when they’re brand new and when they’re relatively old. There are command-line utilities for Linux such as <code>badblocks</code> you can use to check this, see <code>man badblocks</code>.)</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I don’t expect this to require any bug fix, unless one comes to mind, but just wanted to warn others of my ordeal.  Kicksecure seems an ideal OS for booting on a thumb drive for a very secure environment.  It seems more suitable than Tails for my use cases, as I’d also like to install some software to it.  To test it out, I burnt the live disk to a really OLD Kingston thumb drive of 8GB, and used it to install a persistent, encrypted thumb drive OS that I could e.g. install other softs on with SU privileges, a really old SanDisk 16 GB.  It booted and worked great.  I can even install other software by removing the split.</p>
<p>The Verbatim Seaglass drives seemed attractive, as they have lifetime warranties, which seems like a fairly strong expression of confidence in their shelf life.  I bought two 32GB and two 64, burnt the ISO on a Seaglass, and tried to boot it - this from the same ISO which previously worked.  It generated a bunch of errors and then said something like ‘Boot Failed’.  Note that virtual machines are enabled in both the BIOS’s I tried.  I then tried burning it without the extended volume name option in Rufus, and burnt onto a 64GB instead of a 32, and it worked.  I then plugged in the live disk in with another 64GB, and installed to it from Maint.  It seemed to complete quite happily, but it would not boot on any computer I tried it on, just like the first Live disk I originally burnt.  I compared it to the ancient SanDisk drive that worked.  I noticed in the boot order in the BIOS, I had a choice for the USB itself, and another for the same drive, with a Kicksecure name.  The one that started with USB wouldn’t boot, but the Kicksecure choice would.  Looking at two SeaGlass drives I tried to install to, neither show a Kicksecure choice in the BIOS.  It does not work with Secure Boot turned off.</p>
<p>These Seaglass drives SAY that they work for formatting in EXT4 on Linux.  I seem to have only one significant choice on how to create the installed version: EXT4 or BTFS.  I tried both on one of the drives, but neither gave me a Kicksecure boot choice.  I tried booting it on a port on a hub, and two different ports on my desktop.  No dice.</p>
<p>Based on the principle that if you try to install Windows on a machine, and you get errors instead of an OS, it is a virtual certainty that the HW is bad or incompatible  It seems like a foregone conclusion that the reason for the difference is the thumb drives; but feel free to make any suggestions.  I’ve had mostly good luck with Verbatim blank optical media over the years, but IMHO, this does not look good for them.  It seems like they are Kicksecure incompatible, as is.  I don’t know if it’s a bug in the design, M$ paid ‘em to be incompatible (which here seems unlikely, since they advertise Linux compatibility), or there’s a problem with USB 3.2 Gen 1; or maybe I’m missing something.  Maybe a bug in the KickSecure installer is more likely than Windows, but it seems less likely given that the prob. seems to show up depending on the thumb drive it’s installed on.  Implementing a thumb drive should under it all just be a big block of memory..</p>
<p>My machine is an ancient ASRock Tai Chi X570, with a Ryzen 5 3800X.  The SeaGlass USB drives are for USB 3.2 Gen 1.  This matches the specs on most of the USB ports on my desktop, AND on my USB hub.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Request and Idea for including a tmpfs-setup package?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Quiksilver]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Um…last I checked bwrap has <code>bwrap --tmpfs</code> but requires more arguments or flags to do this correctly. This could be a good starting point if you where to make a bwrap wrapper for this.</p>
<pre data-code-wrap="sh"><code class="lang-sh">bwrap \
  --unshare-all \
  --die-with-parent \
  --proc /proc \
  --dev /dev \
  --tmpfs /tmp \
  --tmpfs /run \
  --tmpfs /home \
  --tmpfs /root \
  --tmpfs /var/tmp \
  --tmpfs /var/cache \
  --tmpfs /var/lib \
  --setenv HOME /home/user \
  --setenv XDG_CACHE_HOME /home/user/.cache \
  --setenv XDG_CONFIG_HOME /home/user/.config \
</code></pre>
<p>The problem I see among others would be creating logic to detect the needed runtime dependencies to have exposed to bwrap. <code>--ro-bind /usr /usr</code> might help with automatic with having to know which libs are required. The other issue I could think of is if the application needs internet access and access to ca-certificates and ssl. Thoughts on using bwrap for a wrapper for launching apps in RAM?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Is there some type of wrapper that could be added so you could launch ./applications in some kind overlayroot in tmp based RAM?<br>
This seems like a good work around between wanting “Live Mode” vs mounting all .cache in TMPFS.</p>
<p>Use case = user wants to start a app in RAM but doesn’t want all their RAM resources being used for “Live Mode”.</p>
<p>Two Examples would be generating a bitcoin wallet with Electrum in RAM so that nothing is saved. The other would be generating GPG keys so one could export their private keys without saving them to the system.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This brings me back when using yandex browser as a OSINT browser lol good stuff. There is a “unofficial” appimage and flakpak version of it but I would be leary tbh with you.</p>
<p>There is two ways that I could think of doing it that don’t require virtual machine, the second would more of a setup. Either way would require you to create a new non sudor user for you’re “mother”.</p>
<hr>
<p>One way you “might” be able to do this, I could have sworn I did this with a .deb file of some software back in the day but it wasn’t a browser.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Make a local dir in the “mother” user account /<br>
<code>mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/yandex-browser"</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Download the .deb and instead of installing it system wide try extracting it. /</p>
</li>
</ul>
<pre data-code-wrap="sh"><code class="lang-sh">dpkg-deb -x yandex-browser.deb "$HOME/.local/yandex-browser
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Then find the binary is in the directory and launch it, then you would need to make a desktop shortcut for the command.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The other way would be installing the yandex browser in a Docker container and then after creating desktop shortcut that launches it with a x11 display.</p>
<hr>
<p>I really don’t know why you dont just install a separate more trustable browser then yandex and install some kind of translate extension???</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Noob questions VPN/Display resolution</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Fazeclan]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to install kicksecure, however before I connect to the internet id like to install a VPN. Managed to do it by entering Sysmaint, mount the usb, copy files to /media/ install the .deb file.</p>
<p>However, I have a question. Now that I have a VPN installed in sysmaint (and host user). Will all traffic be router by the vpn, even clearnet/APT upgrades?</p>
<p>Do I first need to launch the VPN in sysmaint - before updating packages/software for it to cover the APT traffic? ISP → VPN → Clearnet/Tor</p>
<p>Regarding the Display. I only get 1200x<em>800 in resolution, no other suggestions. I figured it is a driver issue</em>…? Linux Mint shows alot of resolutions per default. Not kicksecure. <em>Kicksecure is using MESA drivers and my display (1920 x 1080) is not found. I tried force set display with xrandr but doesnt work. Just throws error codes. How do I switch/change to Nouveau drivers? Or does it not having enrolled the secure boot key therefor preventing Nouveau drivers to load? I have read the nouveau drivers should be included in the linux mainkernel by default. My linux mint test-install showed indeed Nouveau drivers was in use.</em></p>
<p>Keep in mind im a total noob to linux. Trying to make the switch to more secure software after having trouble with hacker attacks and malware in windows.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Not sure yet, there are a lot of unknowns (i.e. how does one pass swapfiles to the kernel to resume from, can you pass multiple swapfiles, how do we hook into the hibernation “button” so that clicking it results in a script running that creates the hibernation file, etc.). Might be possible to make the feature available in a later release of Kicksecure 18?</p> ]]></description>

###<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> Qubes OS release

R4.3

### Brief summary

In all templates (at least the ones I've tried; debian-13-xfce, fedora-42-xfce, and whonix-gateway-18), there is an error message in the output of `sudo journalctl --boot` matching the title. This appears to be coming from `/etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.WaitForSession`.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Boot `fedora-42-xfce`.
2. Run `sudo journalctl --boot`
3. Search for `Failed to connect to user scope bus`
4. See error
5. Run `sudo vim /etc/qubes-rpc/qubes.WaitForSession`
6. Replace the line `systemctl --user --wait --quiet is-system-running` with the following:

```
logger "$$: $(id)"
systemctl --user --wait --quiet is-system-running || {
  logger '$$: failed here'
}
logger "$$: made it"
```

7. Reboot the template.
8. Run `sudo journalctl --boot` in the template.
9. Search for `failed here`, and observe that the service is failing when called as `root`, but succeeds when called as `user`, based on the logger output from earlier.

### Expected behavior

`qubes.WaitForSession` should never emit any errors.

### Actual behavior

`qubes.WaitForSession` is emitting the aforementioned error when called as `root`.

### Additional information

I tried making the following modification to `qubes.WaitForSession` in `whonis-gateway-18`, but while this did fix the error message, it also made it so that if one attempts to launch a GUI app in the qube while it is not yet booted, the qube will boot without issues, but the app will never launch. Subsequent attempts to launch GUI apps succeed.

```
logger "$(id)"

logger "trying... $$"
if [ "$(id -u)" = '0' ]; then
  systemctl --wait --quiet is-system-running
else
  systemctl --user --wait --quiet is-system-running
fi

logger "made it! $$"
```

This showed that it took about 9 or 10 seconds from the time that `root` showed a `trying: PID` message to the time that `root` showed a `made it! PID` message (with the PID values matching in both locations). The first GUI app I attempted to launch never showed up, not even after twenty seconds.

The following modification seems to get rid of the error message *and* keep the previous behavior, but I'm not sure if it's correct since it means that `qubes.WaitForSession` may return before the system is "fully booted" (which is what the current, unmodified code does also):

```
if [ "$(id -u)" = '0' ]; then
  exit 0
else
  systemctl --user --wait --quiet is-system-running
fi
```</span></p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Well, there may be security advantages to allowing hibernation. Suspend-to-RAM can be insecure because it leaves decrypted data resident in RAM, allowing an attacker to perform a cold boot attack on a stolen machine (especially if that machine is a laptop). Suspend-to-disk, if encrypted, would make the in-memory data as secure as or more secure than other on-disk data, since it would become on-disk data.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Some thoughts I had on this recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>KVM and VirtualBox both support nested virt, it runs acceptably well on more recent CPUs and can limp along on older ones, and more recent CPUs are necessary to mitigate some side-channel attacks anyway.</li>
<li>Xen will probably gain nested virt support soon, and it may already support it to some degree in the form of (less secure) PV virtualization, i.e. it might be possible to run PV guests within a PVH or HVM guest.</li>
<li>QEMU’s attack surface is probably rather high, Cloud Hypervisor’s is probably lower but isn’t in Debian, but there’s also <a href="https://github.com/kvmtool/kvmtool">kvmtool</a> <s>which I believe is already in Debian</s> (edit: scratch that, I know it was in Ubuntu 16.04 but I guess it’s not in Debian any longer). It’s smaller than QEMU and a bit similar to Cloud Hypervisor, though it has the disadvantage of being written in C. Unsure if it’s intended for security-critical use cases, and it seems to be rather inactive upstream at the moment, but it might be safer than QEMU… not sure.</li>

        <description><![CDATA[ <ul>
<li>Are you sure your downloaded Whonix <code>.ova</code> image is uncorrupted? You can use GPG to verify the image if you aren’t sure, or you can try downloading the image from scratch.</li>
<li>Did you delete the VMs themselves from VirtualBox, or only the disk image files? You need to delete the VMs themselves to get VirtualBox to forget them entirely, you can do this by right-clicking on the VM you wish to delete, and clicking “Remove…”.</li>
<li>What host OS are you using? If you’re on Windows, you may need to disable Hyper-V to prevent VirtualBox VMs from stalling on boot. See <a href="https://forums.whonix.org/t/whonix-only-starts-after-several-attempt-rcpu-preempt-self-detected-stall-on-cpu/22032/8" class="inline-onebox">Whonix only starts after several attempt - rcpu_preempt self-detected stall on CPU - #8 by arraybolt3 - VirtualBox - Whonix Forum</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>I decided to try to disable Hyper-V. Windows 11 Pro makes this ridiculously hard: I had to disable it in at least four different places in order to get it to actually go away:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off</code></li>
<li><code>dism /Online /Disable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V</code></li>
<li>Windows Security → Device Security → Core Isolation → Turn off “Memory integrity”</li>
<li>Registry Editor → Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\DeviceGuard → Set EnableVirtualizationBasedSecurity to 0</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ul>
<p>After doing all of that, VirtualBox started showing a blue microchip icon instead of a green turtle in the lower-right corner of VM windows, and at that point all of the hanging issues appeared to stop. I was able to launch Whonix-Gateway, Whonix-Workstation, and Kicksecure all at the same time, none of them hung and all of them seemed to be booting faster.</p>

        <title>Support for hibernation?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>We need to decide what we’re doing with hibernation. Either we should determine how to set it up in a secure fashion and implement that, or we should remove hibernation-related documentation from the wiki and disable the hibernation button in LXQt.</p>
<p>Hardware support challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation may or may not work properly on Linux. Many users seem to have it working without issues, I have yet to get it working on a machine here. From what I’ve heard, SteamOS supports hibernation and has it working reliably, so maybe it’s robust enough to deploy in general now.</li>
</ul>
<p>Security challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hibernation takes data that is intended to be ephemeral, and makes it persistent. Any secrets, unsaved work, live-booted virtual machines, etc., are all dumped to a swapfile or swap partition when the system is hibernated, making them much easier for an attacker to access if they can get access to the volume containing the swap file/partition.</li>
<li>This can be mitigated somewhat by using full disk encryption, however this is vulnerable to the possibility that the user will choose a weak encryption passphrase, and of course there’s always the <a href="https://xkcd.com/538/">$5 wrench problem</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Technical challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>swap-file-creator would probably need to change in order to support hibernation. Right now we use an encrypted swapfile with an ephemeral encryption key, allowing swap to be used safely but also making it impossible to recover after a reboot. We may also need to do something with the way in which the swapfile is managed, since we need to have a single, static swapfile, we can’t be dynamically creating a new one on every boot or similar.</li>
<li>Hibernation is not reliable if you are trying to hibernate into an existing swapfile. If memory is filled and swap is partially filled, there won’t be enough space left in the swapfile to save the remaining contents of RAM into. SteamOS reportedly gets around this by using a dedicated hibernation file (which I guess means they probably somehow give the resume mechanism multiple swapfiles?).</li>
<li>Hibernation would need to be disabled when FDE was not in use, unless we want to implement something where the user is prompted for a one-time-use passphrase for securing the hibernation file, which is then prompted for upon resume. (Actually, that could be really neat, even with FDE, since it would mean an attacker would have to break both the FDE key and the hibernation key in order to get access to RAM contents. This would require the user to have a very good memory though.)</li>
<li>Related: <a href="https://packages.debian.org/trixie/cryptsetup-suspend" class="inline-onebox">Debian -- Details of package cryptsetup-suspend in trixie</a> Unsure whether we’d want to use this with hibernation or not, or if it works with dracut.</li>

<p>I personally would prefer not doing this. The taskbar at the top has been part of the core UX of both Whonix and Kicksecure for quite a while, and having the two projects be mostly functionality equivalent from a UX standpoint is valuable IMO since it means users who use one automatically are used to how to use the other. I don’t particularly like the idea of moving the taskbar to the bottom, but if we were to do it, I’d want it done to both Whonix and Kicksecure in tandem. Making it so that Kicksecure uses the panel at the top in VMs but not on physical hardware would be even worse since now users who are used to using Kicksecure in a VM will boot it on physical hardware and get confused.</p>

<p>The reason i said it should be at the bottom by default because thats the lxqt-debian default and all distros with lxqt (i have tested).

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think “everyone else does it like this” really is a good argument for “we should do it like this too”. Arguably having Kicksecure “feel” different than Windows or Mac is a good thing since it can help a user break away from the mindset of how they use Windows (which is probably shockingly insecure or at least inadvisable) and get used to using a new tool in a new way. Having the taskbar at the top is also arguably good because window titlebars are at the top, thus everything needed for window management (opening new apps, moving windows, switching windows, quick-launching apps, etc.) is at the top of the screen and easy to reach. Finally, if we want to use the “what everyone else does” argument, Raspberry Pi OS puts the taskbar at the top. MacOS doesn’t put the application dock at the top but it does put the application menu and system tray there. GNOME puts everything at the top by default too.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Some questions before switching</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@carylshaky]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I’m currently using endeavour os on two computers(one with additional nvidia GPU and the other one just with integrated intel’s). I like it mainly because:</p>
<ol>
<li>it never breaks(like after updates etc) and I used different ones before that(ubuntu, fedora, manjaro etc). This one I use on both computers like over 2 years now and with no issues.</li>
<li>for the nvidia GPU laptop I don’t need to think what to do each time something is not right etc. The drivers just work (I use the nvidia’s drivers the system suggest to install).</li>
</ol>
<p>BUT… despite I use hardened kernel, I know that kicksecure is probably way more secure and much more privacy respected system. That’s why I wanna switch, but the above two things are stopping me from it.</p>
<p>Can you please clarify the two points above, because I’m not really a techie and don’t wanna deal with all the under-stuff. I just want my system to just work and be as secure and private as possible.</p>
<p>I feel like when I’ll install it I’ll end up switching back because I will need to pull my hairs off again dealing with the nvidia GPU drivers or that some day after an update the system will not boot or something will not work and again I will pull my hairs off.</p>
<p>P.S: forgot to mention that I use KDE plasma and highly used to it, in case it matters somehow</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I wouldnt go with these fancy features if anything has security problems, even if it will be leveled down to shutdown and restart only. So the rule is which one is making security issues? just delete it.</p>
<p>If hibernation providing problems, then remove this ability.. based on this rule the development will move on which will resolve every security concern.</p> ]]></description>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There may be a misunderstanding on your side or my side here.</p>
<p>usbguard-notifier is <strong>not</strong> sudo and does not give account <code>user</code> general sudo/root privileges in user session.</p>
<p>The usbguard daemon runs as root and exposes an IPC interface. Kicksecure adds an IPCAccessControl rule that says “users in this group are allowed to tell usbguard to accept/reject a device.” The daemon enforces that itself.</p>
<p>So the desktop user only gets a narrow capability (authorize/reject USB devices). Not full sudo/root.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Scenario Targeted: user buys USB peripheral online (ie. charging cable, adapter, or mass storage). The USB is swapped with a malicious one in via mail tampering and is swapped for a BadUSB.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>For example, a malicious keyboard could always inject extra malicious keystrokes. I.e. inject a unicode character that makes the text that follows invisible, then inject malicious commands to install malware.</p>
<p>Expanded <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/USBGuard#Limitations">USBGuard, Limitations</a> just now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>USBGuard is a device-level gate, not a keystroke-level firewall. Once you have decided “this is a keyboard, and I will allow it,” the operating system intentionally trusts it exactly like a real human typing. At that point:</p>
<ul>
<li>it can send any keystrokes,</li>
<li>including weird Unicode/control sequences,</li>
<li>including opening a terminal and pasting a malicious payload.</li>
</ul>
<p>USBGuard can help before that point (by refusing extra/composite/suspicious HIDs, or “second keyboard” devices). It cannot help after you have allowed a malicious keyboard.</p>
<p>The only protection is “do not allow the wrong keyboard be accepted in the first place”. “Accept a malicious keyboard and hope USBGuard filters bad keystrokes” is impossible.</p>

<p>Back to your scenario.</p>
<ul>
<li>Charging cable:
<ul>
<li>In a good case, that should be invisible and only show up as the device that is actually connected to it.</li>
<li>In a bad case, it’s emulates a second keyboard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adapter: Same as above.</li>
<li>mass storage: If one USB keyboard is already connected before one plugs in a BadUSB that pretends to be mass storage but also has a hidden keyboard - and suppose our USBGuard rules are set up correctly, then that hidden keyboard interface will be rejected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>[1] Let’s suppose a user is using their notebooks internal keyboard (not USB) only but unknowingly has a BadUSB mass storage device that also comes with a hidden keyboard connected at boot time.</p>
<p>How to prevent this?</p>
<p>Default configuration could disallow all USB devices by default unless explicitly, manually allowed by the user.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t work if the notebook internal keyboard is USB based. In that case, we would have to allow 1 USB keyboard at boot time. Can probably be scripted.</p>
<p>But even if we had this. For best protection, the user would then have to review their USB devices and create their own configuration file. The user would need to have advanced knowledge about USBGuard.</p>
<p>But if the user has advanced knowledge of USBGuard does really our existing configuration get into the way?</p>
<p>This is a clear case of <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Stable_Version_User_Experience#Security_versus_Usability">Security versus Usability</a> / <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Reasonable_Security" class="inline-onebox">Reasonable Security</a>.</p>
<p>This is exactly the security vs. usability point: a distribution default has to stay usable for people who just plug in keyboards, mice, webcams, storage. An expert user who’s worried about mail-swapped cables can (and should) tighten the rules to “no HID at boot except this exact device.”</p> ]]></description>

        <title>My Firefox Snowflake extension seems not to work</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Quiksilver]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Welcome nearkick, What browser are you using?</p>
<p>Last I checked Snowflake’s core transport is built on WebRTC data channels. So if your using something like Librewolf or did some kind of hardening to your browser good chance this is related to WebRTC being disabled in the browser. The other might be some kind of sandboxing issue?</p> ]]></description>
