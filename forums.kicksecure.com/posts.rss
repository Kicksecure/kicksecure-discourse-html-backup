        <title>Scira AI instead of Perplexity</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>In another chat, we discussed adding search engines and touched on the topic of Perplexity. I propose considering replacing Perplexity with Scira AI on kicksecure-welcome-page for the following reasons:</p>
<p>More functionality: Unlike Perplexity, Scira has more modes - 7 compared to 3 - and you can choose between chat only or internet overview only.</p>
<p>Convenience: No registration required, no window asking to register during use, free.</p>
<p>User safety: Scira informs about the absence of cryptocurrency and tokens and asks not to fall for any potential scams in its name on the internet</p>
<p>Open source: This is not a criterion for a search engine, but it aligns with the Freedom Values published on the Kicksecure website</p>
<p>Works with Tor/VPN without Captcha: Perplexity does not work with Tor and often asks to complete a Captcha for some locations with NordVPN and Mullvad VPN<br>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This becomes rather difficult for me to follow. Discussing multiple search engines in 1 forum thread quickly gets confusing.</p>
<p>It <strong>might</strong> be the case that <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#Search_Engines_Criteria">Search Engines Criteria</a> are disregarded and search engines are only suggested to be promoted due to some other nice goal (such as being Open Source) while having no personal experiences with the search engine and while not personally using the search engine.</p>
<p>I cannot review 10s of search engines. There is limited space on the local browser welcome page. Therefore it needs to be based on criteria and popularity.</p>
<p>Therefore, <strong>please submit search engine related feature requests as per the following documentation / forum feature request template:</strong><br>

</aside>
<p>Yes, you are right. Startpage is a google clone that works well with Tor and VPN and does not attack users with captchas. They will ask you to change your Tor/VPN circuit if your IP is on many blacklists. But they will never block or slow down your search with a captcha.</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>Privacy wrappers will not be considered.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Not considered: Privacy by policy / ownership / location / hosted by which data center</strong>: These factors are not considered. Even trusted projects like Debian and the Tor Project use services like AWS, Fastly, and CDNs. <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Transparency#cite_note-1">[1]</a> Most privacy claims by search engines are just “privacy by policy”, and key infrastructure remains hidden. That’s why trust is still needed. For comparison, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Kicksecure">Kicksecure</a> focuses on security by design and <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Whonix">Whonix</a> on anonymity by design. Anything based only on policy is out of scope.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Not considered: Privacy wrappers</strong>: If a search engine only acts as a privacy wrapper, it’s not considered.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Startpage might be considered because:</p>

        <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Won’t be able to finish this tonight, determining the block device that’s <em>actually</em> underneath the filesystem is a bit of a challenge. One of the comments I wrote in my current code reads:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">    # ... the real underlying device may be many
    # layers deep. For instance, with the Kicksecure ISO, the root filesystem
    # is mounted from an overlayfs which uses a lower directory mounted from a
    # loop device backed by a squashfs located in a directory under a
    # mountpoint backed by /dev/sr0 (when booting from a CD-ROM drive that
    # is).
</code></pre>
<p>There’s also some higher-priority work for me to tackle before I finish this. I have most of the research done though, including how to find underlying devices or mountpoints in a wide variety of situations, and how to monitor the real device once you find it. Also wrote a rather thorough “force shutdown” script based partially on <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/maltfield">@maltfield</a>’s suggestions above.</p> ]]></description>

This security enhancement separates daily user activities from system maintenance tasks. The regular user account can no longer use sudo, su, or pkexec by default. Instead, administrative rights are reserved for a dedicated system maintenance account (sysmaint), reducing security risk…

### Steps to reproduce

n/a

### Expected behavior

Some people may expect the Templates to also be available for Qubes development version (R4.3 at time of writing).

In response to my [announcement of availability of Qubes Kicksecure Template for testers](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/kicksecure-17-template/31893/11), @alimirjamali said:

&gt; Would it be possible to trigger a template build for r4.3 as well? For testing users who are on R4.3 alpha.

### Actual behavior

Templates are built for Qubes stable version only.

### Additional information

Why not simply always build for stable and development version of Qubes? I don't know if there are computational and/or storage restraints by Qubes build servers.

related:

* https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues/9573

### Desired outcome of this ticket

A Qubes core team member expressing the policy. Potential replies:

* &gt; No problem, it is OK and wanted to always build Templates for Qubes stable and Qubes development version.
* &gt; Qubes development Templates should be built on demand or when deemed necessary, but some sort of restraint would be desirable to save disk space.

### Potential outcome

I'd modify [dm-qubes-templates-official-build-commands](https://github.com/Kicksecure/developer-meta-files/blob/master/usr/bin/dm-qubes-templates-official-build-commands) to add either a reminder or automation to build Templates also for Qubes development version.</span></p>

        <title>Unplugging external drive doesn&#39;t trigger a shutdown</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This is definitely a good idea. I took a look at the linked video about BusKill, the idea seems good but I don’t think that’s the method we should use for Kicksecure, because it’s bound to the USB product ID. You have to custom-write the udev rule for the specific USB drive in use. We could in theory detect this on boot I guess, but that seems a bit clunky. I also don’t trust USB drive manufacturers to choose truly unique IDs, as opposed to just putting in some example ID they found in documentation somewhere. (If even AMD can make this mistake with encryption keys related to microcode security, I have no reason to trust off-brand USB drive makers to do any better.) The last thing a user needs is to have their system suddenly shut down because they removed a drive that happened to look suspiciously similar to the main drive.</p>
<p>I looked at how Tails has this implemented, and basically:</p>
<ul>
<li>They have a custom C executable, <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/src/udev-watchdog.c" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">udev-watchdog</a>, which appears to watch for a specified device to be removed and send some sort of signal to whatever called it when that happens.</li>
<li>There’s then a wrapper around it that figures out which device is the boot drive, uses udev-watchdog to watch for when it gets removed, and then triggers a hard shutdown when that happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a somewhat better solution IMO, and the code behind it is open-source so in theory we could just integrate it directly into Kicksecure. It does have some possible downsides though, most notably I found some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tails/comments/xh8njn/tails_wont_shutdown_when_i_pull_usb_stick/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">reports that the feature didn’t always work three years ago</a>, when the last code change <a href="https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/blob/master/config/chroot_local-includes/usr/local/lib/udev-watchdog-wrapper" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">was four years ago</a>. Maybe that was just user error though.</p>
<p>For Kicksecure’s implementation, I’d like to avoid custom C code since Kicksecure tries to use architecture-independent code wherever possible. We can use a udev-based approach similar to Tails, but written using Python and pyudev instead. I’ll try to implement this probably tonight and see what happens.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@sam]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello. Your conclusion about the Startpage is interesting. Essentially, the Startpage is Google with a proxy, but also with a large amount of annoying ads. I think the value of this lies only in the proxy, as services like Searx or 4get.ca can replace it without displaying ads. However, I just conducted a test in Searx (Startpage only) and Startpage with the same query and settings, but the results were slightly different.</p>
<p>P.S. I was also surprised by the presence of Perplexity, and I thought they had fully open-sourced the code. Perhaps the presence of a non-open-source service will confuse those who will install Librewolf, Mullvad or Brave browsers in the future through the “Choose Browser” feature. But this raises the question - will Kicksecure-welcome-page be added to all browsers in the “Choose Browser” list?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I think it’s unnecessary and not worth spending time on it. If you’re going to add new buttons to the panel (such as a journal search, system monitor, firewall…), then the panel will increase in size and will overlap any background.<br>
By the way, have you considered changing the color for Livecheck on the panel: green for live, and yellow/orange/red for persistent mode, to warn users that everything they do will be saved to the system, in order to increase the level of responsibility. When clicking on the circle, you can add a hint “if you’re not sure about your actions, test it in live mode”.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Wow this is very interesting! I used Startpage because of the Tor browser - Tor browser has 2 default search engines: Duckduckgo and Startpage. I thought Tor team chose it for enhanced privacy and security. Startpage has been added to list of default search engines in the secure browsers Mullvad and Librewolf. And also, the guys from<br>
Privacy Guides <a href="https://www.privacyguides.org/en/tools/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Ad-Free Privacy Tool/Service Recommendations - Privacy Guides</a> also recommend Startpage as a safe search engine after their analysis. And the author of searchengine.party put Startpage above Brave, Duckduckgo, and Qwant. It seems, Snowden gave an interview to Startpage and recommended their search engine in this video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_RnBX3l124</a> I liked Startpage for search results and anonymous viewing. At same time your list includes proprietary Perplexity, although this is a very convenient service. for example, it seems to me that Startpage looks more secure than a proprietary service.<br>
As for SearXNG - choice of service is up to you. I just checked that Librewolf uses searx.be server. It seems that in this search engine you can configure search results output from Startpage and then SearXNG can be an alternative if you don’t like Startpage</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thinking about it more, I think even if we do want to implement some form of background customization for sysmaint sessions, it should be rather limited (i.e., we shouldn’t allow making an arbitrary image the desktop background). Reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting an image into the sysmaint account is unsafe almost no matter how you do it:
<ul>
<li>You could launch Firefox and download an image, but the web browser offers a substantial amount of attack surface. One of the main reasons for creating <code>sysmaint-panel</code> in the first place was to discourage the user from launching Firefox in a sysmaint session.</li>
<li>You could download an image into <code>/home/user/Downloads</code> and then copy it into the <code>sysmaint</code> account in a sysmaint session, but that’s tricky due to user account separations in Kicksecure, and you’re still trusting an arbitrary image from a user account that may be compromised. (Obviously you don’t want your <code>user</code> account compromised, but we try to assume it and other user accounts <em>are</em> compromised and design the sysmaint session accordingly.)</li>
<li>You could overcome the clunkiness of having to copy files into the <code>sysmaint</code> account by making there be some way to change the <code>sysmaint</code> account’s background from a user session, but that’s even worse from a security standpoint because now the <code>user</code> account can push arbitrary images into the <code>sysmaint</code> account at will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Image files are a well-known exploit vector due to the complexity of most common image file formats. There probably are zero-days in the image file parsing code used by Qt, if history is any indicator. Therefore image files aren’t something you want to just blindly trust if you can help it.</li>
</ul>
<p>That being said, implementing some form of background customization might be neat, but I’d want to limit it to setting a solid color or gradient background. Currently the background you see in a sysmaint session isn’t an image at all, it’s created on the fly with a Qt CSS theming trick. Allowing the user to choose the start and end colors of the gradient would allow some customization without any of the dangers of images. I’m not sure if that’s something <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> is interested in at the moment, but that’s a theoretical way of doing this.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Add SearXNG and Startpage buttons to kicksecure-welcome-page</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>SearXNG looks neat as a project, but simply “adding the SearXNG search engine” is tricky since SearXNG itself is an open-source project, not a service. Individuals may run public SearXNG services, but in that instance if you use those services, you are trusting whoever runs them with the info you’d be entrusting Google with if you use their search engine. SearXNG’s documentation even warns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Always use an instance which is operated by people you trust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the question then becomes what instance to trust. Personally I’m leery of personal instances because, well, we have no idea who’s running them. It could be a respectable privacy advocate who wants to do the world a favor, it might be the head of the intelligence agency of (insert a nation you dislike here). If an individual was very well-known in the open-source or privacy and security communities, and was able to sustainably run the search engine on their own, it would probably be fine, but otherwise, I’d steer clear there.</p>
<p>Company-run instances are a lot easier to trust ironically, because the entity behind them is known or at least more likely knowable. If they do something shady, it’s also more likely to become publicly known. The searchengine.party site linked by rico lists two company-run SearXNG instances, one run by /e/, and the other one ran by Disroot. Of the two, /e/ is known for <a href="https://www.golem.de/news/datenschutz-e-will-google-ersetzen-2004-147396-4.html" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">selling smartphones with an outdated and probably insecure version of Android, among other security failures</a>, so if I had to pick between them I’d <em>probably</em> trust Disroot a little more. Granted, I don’t necessarily think either of them are going to shuttle your data off to a large corporation, this is just my initial reaction looking at things.</p>
<p>My first impression of Startpage isn’t great:</p>
<ul>
<li>Looking at <a href="https://www.startpage.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">their home page</a>, they claim to quote a few (presumably) high-profile people in the privacy space supporting them, including Edward Snowden, but with no links to the articles they’re (presumably) quoting.</li>
<li>They’re <a href="https://system1.com/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">owned by System1</a>, an advertising company that, in their own words, “<a href="https://system1.com/what-we-do" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">monetizes internet traffic by putting the right ads in front of the right people at the right time.</a>” This is obviously more than a little worrying.</li>
<li>Their search engine solution isn’t open-source, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StartpageSearch/comments/lge9n0/comment/gmtig3v/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">at least partially because they’re using intentionally proprietary anti-spam algorithms</a>, which I guess is <em>reasonable</em> but still non-ideal.</li>
<li>On the plus side, I didn’t see any third-party analytics links when looking through the client-side source code of the home page, so that was good.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately it seems like they’re making a bunch of claims you have to blindly trust, and some claims that, in a worst-case scenario, could technically be true while still leaving the platform privacy-invasive. (I.e., if they’re owned by an advertising company, they don’t exactly have to sell your data to monetize it. Just because they “block 3rd parties from accessing your personal data to target you”, doesn’t mean they can’t use your personal data to target you themselves.)</p>
<p>I took a look at the searchengine.party code, it looks reasonable at first glance, and the code deployed on the website itself is identical to the code from their <a href="https://gitlab.com/nitrohorse/search-engines-compare" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Git repository</a>. They were last updated ten months ago, which is a bit worrying, and <a href="https://gitlab.com/nitrohorse" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the maintainer hasn’t been very active on Gitlab this year</a>, so I’m not sure how well-maintained of a resource it is. Then again, it went a year and two months without an update and then received a bunch of updates ten months ago so maybe that’s just the speed at which it needs to be updated. Some way of automatically re-checking the various data points to ensure it’s accurate would be neat, not sure if that exists yet.</p>
<p>Anyway, in conclusion, I wouldn’t be opposed to adding Disroot’s SearXNG instance to the Kicksecure start page, and think that adding the searchengine.party page might be a good idea too. I don’t think adding Startpage is a good idea at the moment.</p> ]]></description>

However, the current accurate information is to reboot and start a sysmaint session for updates. This information is also not relevant for the sysmaint session, as there is no Start menu there.

<p>Right now the background is hardcoded, though it differs between Kicksecure, Whonix-Gateway, and Whonix-Workstation. In theory it could be made configurable, I’m not sure if that’s a good idea though since right now the background allows easy identification of the underlying OS (which is useful if you have multiple VMs of different kinds running at the same time).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello. browser choice - brilliant solution! This will close discussions about a secure browser, and new users will be able to get acquainted with new browsers that they did not know about. I would like to add 2 sentences for consideration:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add a signature “proprietary” or “not open source” if there are proprietary browsers in the list. I agree that describing browsers will be redundant due to possible bias, but information about the code is not biased and is very important in assessing security (browsers do not write about proprietary code on their own sites). This will allow new users to assess the risks of installing Google Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera, Yandex Browser… This information can be taken from the site <a href="http://alternativeto.net" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">alternativeto.net</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a browser selection to open-link-confirmation. Users will be able to choose Tor Browser or Mullvad Browser with VPN for suspicious links. To have Tor Browser in the list, you can pre-install torbrowser-launcher in Kicksecure or use only torbrowser-launcher for Tor Browser installation from “browser choice” (manual installation from the site <a href="https://www.torproject.org/download/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Tor Project | Download</a> does not add the browser to bin)</p>
</li>

<p>I have tried to use all of Kicksecure repositories (including Testers and Developers) I switched using GUI tool but full-upgrade haven’t chabged anything - Kicksecure version is still 17.2.8.5. Was I doing something wrong?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Add SearXNG and Startpage buttons to kicksecure-welcome-page</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@linuxer]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello</p>
<p>Yes, please add Startpage button. I love Startpage and Kicksecure homepage. Its great to have arsenal of the best search engines on homepage - its faster and easier then bookmarks with different search engines. Many users hide bookmarks on startup tab.<br>
Homepage background is too bright and hurts eyes when launching browser in the evening or at night - at night want to close page faster to save eyes. Maybe elephant at sunset? And you can add ‘<em>functionality, reviews, cybersecurity manuals , solutions to known problems</em>’ to doc search. Kicksecure documentation and wiki are very cool - its more than just technical documentation. There is a lot of unique info about cybersecurity and privacy. New users will not only see in browser where to look for error solutions, but they will also want to learn more about cybersecurity - perhaps they will change their views on many topics, as happened to me. In various chats users often ask where they can read in detail about cybersecurity and I recommend Kicksecure / Whonix wiki. Patrick, you’ve done an excellent job!</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Forensic after deleting VMs</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t have a list of things to shred;</li>
<li>the list keeps changing over time;
<ul>
<li>for example, this had been identified <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/pull/304" class="inline-onebox">Disable PStore by raja-grewal · Pull Request #304 · Kicksecure/security-misc · GitHub</a>;</li>
<li>unknown unknowns;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Computer storage hardware is not designed with non-persistence and anti-forensics as a primary goal in mind.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The most secure way to avoid data persistence is to avoid data ever being written, ideally combined with <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Read-only">Read-Only: Setting Hard Drives to Read-Only</a>.</p>

<p>I saw comparison of Tails and grub-live. Does this table apply only to Kicksecure on host and vm? Or does it also apply to Kicksecure-usb in grub-live mode?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Added to <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub-live" class="inline-onebox">grub-live - boot an existing Host OS or VM into Live Mode</a> documented just now:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This wiki page documents grub-live mostly as a standalone software package outside the context of Kicksecure. Any elements related to Kicksecure are clearly marked as such (“Kicksecure feature”).</p>

        <title>Forensic after deleting VMs</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I failed to provide enough context for wear leveling. Disk damage is not the main issue. The main issue is, that disk shredding can be ineffective.</p>
<p>The problem is that the hard drive is not just a hard drive. It’s a its own “computer” with a complex firmware (operating system).</p>
<p>The issue with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wear_leveling" class="inline-onebox">Wear leveling - Wikipedia</a> is that the disk controller tells the kernel “file deleted” while in reality the sector has been marked unusable but still contains data, which can be recovered by data recovery professionals with low level disk controller commands. This is documented here in more detail:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#Advice_for_Solid-state_Drives_and_USB_Storage">Advice for Solid-state Drives and USB Storage</a></p>
<p>(And that’s the link I should have used.)</p> ]]></description>
