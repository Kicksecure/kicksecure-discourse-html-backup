<p>What would probably be most helpful is if you could share the output of <code>cd /sys/class/leds/smc::kbd_backlight &amp;&amp; grep . *</code>. This will show the names and contents of all the files in that directory. That might provide enough information to write a utility that will work with Kicksecure and will allow adjusting the backlight, and depending on how things go, that might be something that can be integrated into Kicksecure later (though <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/patrick">@Patrick</a> would be the one to decide that).</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Is the SD card <em>bigger</em> than the USB drive? If so, it should just work. (Growing the root partition could be challenging, I’m not sure we have that documented anywhere, but even without growing the partition, the system should work.) Of course, if the card is smaller, then there are problems. Generally it’s a good idea to clone from a smaller drive to a bigger drive rather than cloning between two drives of the same size, since two drives that claim to be the same size (32 GB for instance) might be slightly different sizes “under the hood”, which can give you the same complications as cloning to a too-small drive.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks.</p>
<p>So far so good. I am using Linux dd to ‘clone’ the USB to a MicroSD card and, apart from a device size mismatch(my bad), its looking good.</p>
<p>I can boot my MicroSD TAILS OS from the grub boot menu whilst its in the SD slot or when mounted in a USB-A/C adaptor, but they are different from the Kicksecure boot method, so it remains to be seen if it works.</p>
<p>But, I’ll report back when I have purchased a matching size MicroSD.</p>
<p>I’m very hopeful.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I have not personally tried this (systems that are able to boot from an SD card slot are rather rare in my experience), but I see no reason why it shouldn’t work. As long as your system’s firmware can access the SD card at boot time, you should be able to just install Kicksecure onto it like you’d <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/USB_Installation">install it persistently on a USB drive</a>, and then use it. Linux sees SD cards as block device just like USB drives and internal drives, so there should be no issues there.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>MacBook Pro keyboard backlight issue</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>This might be a tricky one. Apple keyboard backlights are <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Mac/Troubleshooting#Keyboard_backlight">apparently controlled by a sysfs file</a>, which likely requires administrator permissions to modify. Existing tools might not work with user-sysmaint-split installed unless they install a privileged background process that actually does the job of changing the backlight brightness. If you remove <code>user-sysmaint-split</code> though, you might be able to use something like <a href="https://packages.debian.org/stable/brightnessctl">brightnessctl</a> to adjust the keyboard backlight.</p>
<p>I unfortunately do not have an Intel-based Macbook to test with, so I can’t really create a tool for adjusting this that integrates with Kicksecure. (I made <a href="https://github.com/Kicksecure/desktop-config-dist/blob/master/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/backlight_tool_dist/backlight_tool_dist.py">a tool</a> for adjusting the display backlight, which is part of Kicksecure 18; a similar tool would probably work for the keyboard backlight, but would require someone with compatible hardware to create the tool or add support for keyboard backlight changing to the existing tool.)</p> ]]></description>

<p>For guard relays, almost certainly yes. If your machine can’t connect to other machines over IPv6, Tor won’t be able to either. The guard relays however might then talk to other relays that do have IPv6 support.</p>

<p>FYI, Kicksecure 18 is out and 17 will likely be deprecated soon. If you have the time, you might want to give it a shot, it has a lot of neat security improvements over version 17 (like Wayland by default and a “panic button” for instant shutdown).</p>

<p>Using <code>Etc/UTC</code> as a timezone is more of an anonymity measure than a security one, and we generally keep the anonymity enhancements in Whonix.

<p>Edit: You “created two equal Live ISO images, each on a separate USB Drive, as per instructions”? I don’t think the instructions say to do that; you aren’t supposed to flash the Kicksecure ISO to the installation target drive. You’re only supposed to flash it to the installation source drive, then you boot from the source drive and install Kicksecure to the target drive like you’d install it to an internal drive. wipefs will probably fix the target drive in this scenario.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Yeah you install the ISO to USB like you would any Linux ISO, then at GRUB screen select SYSMAINT installation. Then once booted to the desktop where the SYSMAINT panel appears plug in another flash drive and start the Installer then the other USB drive will appear as a media selection to install Kicksecure onto. This is no different then installing on internal or external HDD/SSD, you just got to make sure you plug in the media you wish to install from so the installer can read it and make sure you select the right drive.</p> ]]></description>

Upon post install I checked and <code>cat /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/disable_ipv6</code> returned 0 (enabled) and <code>ip -6 addr show</code> returned a inet6 address.</p>
<p>I had to create a config file <code>/etc/sysctl.d/99_disable-ipv6.conf</code> with these lines to disable it:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=1
net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6=1
</code></pre>
<p>Upon further looking at the github README:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Networking:</p>
<p>Optional - Disable the entire IPv6 stack to reduce attack surface.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But it doesn’t point to the exact configuration file that implements this.</p>
<p>I’m not using this installation as a server, and I’m skeptical of the “IPv6 evangelism” that circulates in many networking sysadmin circles, not Kicksecure. My concerns stem mainly from two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>IPv6 doesn’t provide the implicit NAT barrier that IPv4 does.</li>
<li>Privacy implications of EUI‑64 that can expose hardware identifiers.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>So here are two questions about IPv6 and Kicksecure.</strong></p>
<h2><a name="p-3989-h-1-does-disabling-ipv6-reduce-tor-anonymity-set-2" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3989-h-1-does-disabling-ipv6-reduce-tor-anonymity-set-2"></a>1. Does Disabling IPv6 reduce Tor Anonymity set?</h2>
<p>Does disabling the IPv6 network stack on my machine then in return prevent the Tor Daemons from using IPv6 relays? (Reduced relay pool to select from)<br>
Will Tor only connect to IPv4 relays and ignore IPv6 relays?</p>
<h2><a name="p-3989-h-2-can-we-have-ipv6-privacy-extensions-enabled-without-breaking-root-dhcp-server-3" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3989-h-2-can-we-have-ipv6-privacy-extensions-enabled-without-breaking-root-dhcp-server-3"></a>2. Can we have IPv6 privacy extensions enabled without breaking root DHCP server?</h2>
<p>Can we enable full IPv6 (for Tor daemon’s IPv6 relay access and machine outbound) with privacy extensions, while maintaining a stable IPv6 address bound to your DHCPv6 server’s DUID for reliable client leasing and server reachability as to not add breakage for users needing the IPv6 server?</p>
<p><em>Config note here worth mentioning <code>man nm-settings-dbus</code></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The special values “llt” and “ll” will generate a DUID of type LLT or LL (see RFC 3315) based on the current MAC address of the device.<br>
dhcp-duid=ll  # Fallbacks to link-local DUID for IPv6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The bottom line is can we keep a stable, DUID derived address for server accessibility while also generating temporary privacy focused addresses for outbound traffic (Tor relay/daemon and general machine use like e.g. in a users post about reticulum use)?</p> ]]></description>

<p>This post is about what I believe to be called the Volume Manager plugin.</p>
<ul>
<li>System volumes shown</li>
</ul>
<p>After install I noticed the “Removable Media” plugin on the lxqt panel in the upper right corner shows <code>/boot</code>, <code>/rootfs</code>, and <code>/efi</code> as mount points. Can the widget be told to ignore system or not show system volumes? I can see users accidentally unmounting these.</p>
<ul>
<li>“Removable Media” showing on center of desktop at boot</li>
</ul>
<p>After I booted I saw the panel plugin the center of screen as if it was a desktop icon but after like 5 seconds it disappeared. My guess is it is a bug with Wayland? Thought I would mention it.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@exfil]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I’d like to break my feedback into separate posts, each covering a single topic, to keep things clear. First, I have to say I’m genuinely impressed with Kicksecure. Over the years I’ve written countless post install scripts just to harden a vanilla Debian installation. Despite trying several distributions, I always end up back at Debian. Only to be frustrated by its insecure defaults and the tedious manual hardening required. Literally editing config files till I go crazy lol. Kicksecure feels refreshingly different, the defaults are already security focused, which is fantastic. Kudos to the developers and the community!</p>
<h3><a name="p-3986-installation-details-1" class="anchor" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com#p-3986-installation-details-1"></a>Installation Details</h3>
<hr>
<p>Version:           Kicksecure 17.4.4.6</p>
<p>Install medium:    Sandisk USB</p>
<p>Partition format:  ext4 (auto-formatted)</p>
<hr>
<p>I flashed the ISO to one USB stick, then used a second USB as the target for the installation (for testing purposes).</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing “Etc/UTC” Timezone Option</li>
</ul>
<p>Under timezone there is no <code>Etc/UTC</code> which I really wanted to set and had to set after post install <code>timedatectl set-timezone "Etc/UTC"</code>. This isn’t really Kicksecures fault but a Calamares configuration issue. I believe this timezone is omitted or ignored in the default installer but I haven’t digged enough yet to see.</p>
<ul>
<li>Can’t show LUKS password (LUKS Password Visibility)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, this is an installer side matter rather than a Kicksecure problem. While many installers (e.g., Ubuntu) let you toggle password visibility for user accounts, the Calamares stage that collects the LUKS passphrase lacks such a toggle. In a previous Debian install, long some time ago I entered the wrong LUKS password. I had to reinstall cause I was off on the keys I set for the LUKS password at this stage.</p>
<p>Is there a way to expose a “show password” option for the LUKS field in the Calamares configuration? If not, perhaps this could be proposed upstream to libkpmcore?</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Try booting from the live Kicksecure USB, then run <code>sudo wipefs --all /dev/USB_DEVICE</code>, replacing <code>USB_DEVICE</code> with the device you intend to install Kicksecure to. Be warned, this will delete all data on the target device (recovery might be possible but is definitely non-trivial), so be very careful to specify the right device and make sure the target USB doesn’t have any data you care about. (<code>lsblk</code> is usually helpful if you need to figure out which device is the right device.)</p>
<p>Once that’s done, reboot and try to install onto the target USB again. Hopefully that should fix whatever is making Calamares ignore the target USB.</p>
<p>Edit: You “created two equal Live ISO images, each on a separate USB Drive, as per instructions”? I don’t think the instructions say to do that; you aren’t supposed to flash the Kicksecure ISO to the installation target drive. You’re only supposed to flash it to the installation source drive, then you boot from the source drive and install Kicksecure to the target drive like you’d install it to an internal drive. wipefs will probably fix the target drive in this scenario.</p> ]]></description>

<p>It starts with <code>INFO:</code> and ends with <code>ok</code>. So unless that is something you’re interested in, you can very safely move your focus away from these kind of messages.</p>
<p>Once that message is shown, all that swap-file-creator does is <code>exit 0</code>, which means it terminates itself with status “success”. And that’s it. swap-file-creator won’t have any future effect on the boot or system.</p>

<p>In this case, never mind swap-file-creator. It’s not needed and can be ignored.</p>
<p>If the boot is frozen after swap-file-creator, doesn’t mean it’s caused by swap-file-creator.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, having a swapfile versus not having one isn’t important enough to be shown during boot. If there is enough RAM (at the time of writing 2 GB), then swap-file-creator does not need to say anything at all by default. So that’s a usability bug which will be fixed in the next release.</p>
<p>In the future, we can move information level messages can be moved to <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Systemcheck">systemcheck</a>.</p>
<p>I used to be under the impression, swap-file-creator is the thing you’re interested here. However, it might be a different issue. Frozen boot? In that case, we can suggest other things. In that case…</p>
<p>As per <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Recovery#Recovery_Mode">Recovery Mode</a>…</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove kernel parameter <code>loglevel=0</code> and <code>quiet</code>.</li>
<li>Follow the <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Grub#Kernel_Boot_Parameter_Change">Temporary Kernel Boot Parameter Change</a> instructions to change the kernel parameters.</li>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you Patrick. I’m gonna have a strong flask of coffee and read all this, but in parallel, if my endgame is not a VBox VM but usb with ks18 morphed on trixie, should I:</p>
<ul>
<li>install d13 from inside the live d13 lxqt iso, select encryption and default partition etc</li>
<li>Run k18 commands</li>
<li>Disable swapfile to get past it or do something else? Sorry dumb question</li>
</ul>
<p>So far my attempts with usb or VM using with d13 net iso or ixqt have not got me past swapfile creator during boot. I’m too dumb to know if this is down to d13 configuration or my k18 choices. If you were to install to a usb, what setting would you choose to avoid swapfile creator issues? The pc has a lot of ram. Very appreciative of your patience and support</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Morphing K18 on Trixie issues</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@GaS58Bc]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Little update. Created a new VM through the Debian 13 lxqt live installation process. Ticked the encryption box and accepted default partition etc. ks18 commands worked fine. FYI I’m using the install ‘for host os’ and not ‘for any other VMs (not qubes)’ - could be a wrong choice screw up on my part.</p>
<p>on reboot I have to enter encryption passphrase for grub, then KS splash, then again the passphrase for vbox_harddisk. Swapfile seems to work this time, e.g. enough ram; capping at 10% disk size; calculating swap file in mb 1998; then stops after ‘Info: File var/swapfile’ (1 GB) ready Ok.</p>
<p>Btw - thanks for all the advice so far….really appreciated</p> ]]></description>

<p>Try editing <code>/etc/default/grub.d/40_kernel_hardening.cfg</code>, and comment out the line <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX bdev_allow_write_mounted=0"</code>. Does that fix it?</p>

<p>Are any error messages shown when this happens? If you run <code>torbrowser</code> in a terminal, then use it until it crashes, are any messages printed to the terminal immediately before the crash?</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>Yes, that is expected behavior. swap-file-creator only creates swapfiles on encrypted volumes for security reasons, and only creates them <em>directly</em> on LUKS volumes.</p>

<p>Did you enable encryption here? The live installer has a checkbox on the partitioning screen for “Encrypt disk”, right above the partition layout summary. (This will give you LUKS without LVM, which is what you want.)</p> ]]></description>
