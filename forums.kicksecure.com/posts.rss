        <title>Swap-file-creator missing when in Qubes templates (morphing &amp; official derivative templates)</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Crok]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I tend to have a promising idea for digging into something right after posting a question.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">apt-cache rdepends swap-file-creator

swap-file-creator
Reverse Depends:
  non-qubes-enhancements-cli
  non-qubes-vm-enhancements-cli
</code></pre>
<p>I would interpret this as it being only relevant for <code>non-qubes</code> systems? Can someone point me towards some kind of documentation or explanation why this is?<br>
Is it related to Qubes already being installed on an encrypted disk by default? Wouldn’t there be a benefit from a per-boot encrypted file still, which Qubes has been talking about for something close to a decade?</p>
<p>Just throwing around theories as to why this is, I might be missing something in the related docs.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Swap-file-creator missing when in Qubes templates (morphing &amp; official derivative templates)</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Crok]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I’ve been using Kicksecure and it’s derivatives for a good while by now in Qubes VMs and on servers (Kicksecure in Qubes and on server is morphed, Whonix 17 templates are official Qubes templates) and just realized that I have a seemingly plain, unencrypted swap partition on all Qubes templates. The morphed version on the server host looks correct, if I am not mistaken. Reading the documentation, my impression is that  <code>swap-file-creator</code> should change this by default on Kicksecure systems.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>

/etc/fstab entry in morphed Debian template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

/etc/fstab entry in my Whonix-Workstation AppVM installed from the official template on Qubes OS <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>

Several command outputs from my morphed Kicksecure on a virtual server <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/swap-file-creator-missing-when-in-qubes-templates-morphing-official-derivative-templates/644/1">(click for more details)</a>
<p>The package is also not installed on any of the machines except for the morphed host (actually a VPS). It looks like I chose <code>kicksecure-qubes-cli</code> for the Kicksecure template on Qubes while morphing and, again, the Whonix templates were not built by myself. On the VPS, I chose <code>kicksecure-cli-host</code>. (Writing this… is there potentially a difference between the <code>host</code> and the <code>qubes</code> packages in regards to the package being installed/not installed?)</p>
<p>Trying to find an answer to this still left me with two related questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the documentation outdated? It states that it should be installed by default: /wiki/Swap-file-creator#Installation (posting the link resulted in an error, sorry)<br>
That said, I don’t know what cases <em><strong>“otherwise”</strong></em> covers or what history, intention or background the sentence has, though.</li>
<li>Is there any other countermeasure against potentially sensitive information being written to the disk via swapping, which I was not able to find in the wiki, or may, for instance, keys have ended up on my disk?</li>
</ul>

        <title>Kicksecure as Server OS?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Patrick]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks to <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> in the next release of Kicksecure 17.2.3.9 and above, it will be possible to use D-I (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian-Installer" class="inline-onebox">Debian-Installer - Wikipedia</a>, the “console looking” Debian installer) (not calamares!).</p>
<p>Would that help?</p>
<p>It supports preseed (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preseed" class="inline-onebox">Preseed - Wikipedia</a>) (<a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/Preseed" class="inline-onebox">DebianInstaller/Preseed - Debian Wiki</a>) and whatnot. These are features inherited from D-I.</p>
<p>Could we make D-I install only the <code>kicksecure-cli(-host)</code> meta package? Or would we require a separate headless ISO? Or an option in calamares?</p>

        <title>Use Btrfs as the default journaling file system</title>

        <description><![CDATA[ <blockquote>
<p>filesystem: “unknown”</p>

<p>Correct, this means go with whatever the default.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let’s just change the default and avoid adding an extra question?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BTRFS comes with significant additional maintenance needs and benefits from the user having some level of technical expertise. I would be leery of using it as the default. Lubuntu, Kubuntu, and Ubuntu Unity have been shipping with a multi-choice between ext4, BTRFS, and xfs for a while now and no one has reported problems figuring it out (presumably because they stick with the default of ext4 if in doubt). Those who know what they’re doing can change it manually, was my thinking.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Are Tor hidden services on Kicksecure safe against entry-guard attacks?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@NobodyImportant]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi, I am making this topic because I am curious about the current safety status of using Kicksecure to run a Tor hidden service under default configurations, and what mitigations against entry-guard attacks are currently recommended and supported, if any.</p>
<p>I understand that Tor itself is baked-in with Vanguards Lite, but unless I am misunderstanding the documentation, this is not appropriate for a hidden service that is intended to be active for more than one month. (I would provide this documentation for review, but the board will not let me post a link).</p>
<p>From searches on the Whonix forums, I have seen it suggested to downgrade Tor and then re-enable Vanguards? (Again, I can’t include the link to this…)</p>
<p>Is this correct, and are there any special requirements for re-enabling Vanguards or does it simply need to be installed and enabled via systemctl?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Can not run flatpak apps after Kicksecure update</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@qtzvytqr77x4t5cq]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I do not know about appimage. For flatpak, I have been suspicious about their sandbox ever since I read flatkill website (<a href="https://flatkill.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://flatkill.org/</a> and <a href="https://flatkill.org/2020/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://flatkill.org/2020/</a>). Also see <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#flatpak" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Linux | Madaidan's Insecurities</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, today I started getting a warning saying that tor browser might not be as secure in my operating system configurations. This was because I set kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0 using previous instructions. See <a href="https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/issues/43101" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Security features warning links to Firefox installation support page with incomplete info (#43101) · Issues · The Tor Project / Applications / Tor Browser · GitLab</a> and <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/install-firefox-linux?as=u&amp;utm_source=inproduct#w_security-features-warning" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Install Firefox on Linux | Firefox Help</a>.</p>
<p>I deleted /etc/sysctl.d/99-disable-unpriv-userns.conf (created using previous instructions), and now I do not get the warning. So I guess that is another reason to prefer kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=1.</p> ]]></description>

<p>“Some other distribution is doing that” is also an insufficient rationale. As distribution developer I need to decide based on actual technical considerations. If some distribution adds <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_(user_interface)#Dash">spyware</a>, Kicksecure won’t do the same. If some distribution add convenience features that significantly worsens user security, Kicksecure won’t do that either.</p>
<p>That’s why derivatives exist. Because these have different goals and make different decisions than major or other distributions.</p>

<p>And what’s the issue with that?</p>
<p>Some distribution has, promotes, encourages feature <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Transparent_Encryption">TPM Transparent Encryption</a>, which is less secure than password based encryption.</p>
<p>And then what?</p>
<p>Is it some some hypothetical consideration:<br>
user sees Ubuntu supports TPM → user vaguely thinking “TPM security something” → user uses Ubuntu instead of Kicksecure → loss for Kicksecure?</p>
<p>No, I doubt that is how marketing works. There’s a huge list of <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/#security">Kicksecure security features</a>. If that doesn’t convince the user, nothing will. I doubt adding “TPM encryption” (whatever the implementation) will make a difference.</p>
<p>Users instead resort to other criteria on how to decide which distribution to use.   (Supposedly) expert opinions, other authorities (media), visual design of website or software as an expression of professionalism, reddit, size of distribution, whatnot.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose calamares did support TPM transparent encryption by default… Then Kicksecure might even disable the feature by default.</p>
<p>If it’s just about running checklists and showing Kicksecure is great then this could even be framed in another way.</p>

<p>Protection from an adversary that is sniffing full disk encryption passwords using cameras, doesn’t need require a TPM. Protection from that requires only an additional keyfile on USB. Keyfiles predate TPM.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but you missed a crucial point: TPM adds an extra layer of security by binding the key file to the device’s hardware, meaning the encryption keys or key files will be tied to the specific hardware of the device. This prevents an attacker from simply copying the key file to another machine to decrypt the data. The decryption key is “unsealed” only when the system’s hardware and firmware are in a trusted state, thereby adding protection against physical attacks and tampering.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Relying solely on TPM with a PIN or password is not the same as deriving a cryptographic key from both the password and the TPM. If the TPM is compromised - through physical tampering - the encryption is broken, even if the password is strong. This creates a single point of failure, allowing attackers to bypass password protections entirely once the TPM is compromised. Users of FDE Password + USB Keyfile benefit from enhanced security because the complete key is genuinely derived from both the user-provided password and the USB keyfile. This means that both components are required for decryption, adding significant entropy and making it much harder for an attacker to compromise the system. Unlike setups relying solely on TPM, this approach eliminates a single point of failure, requiring an attacker to break both the password and the physical key, which provides more robust protection.</p>

</aside>
<p>Just because it’s going to have TPM support doesn’t mean it will be bloated; that’s a wrong assumption to begin with. We can also remove FDE support in this case (which can be done post-installation), and we call that keep it minimal. So, ‘minimal’ is undefined, and TPM is default in almost all main distro installers, whether Debian, Qubes, openSUSE…etc. It’s not like we’re doing the unusual.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>True, but you missed a crucial point: TPM adds an extra layer of security by binding the key file to the device’s hardware, meaning the encryption keys or key files will be tied to the specific hardware of the device. This prevents an attacker from simply copying the key file to another machine to decrypt the data. The decryption key is “unsealed” only when the system’s hardware and firmware are in a trusted state, thereby adding protection against physical attacks and tampering.</p>

</aside>
<p>It really doesn’t matter how TPM will be used by the user, what matters is that support for it exists and is easily available.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that TPM has undeniable utility, whether it is fully trusted or not is beside the point. Not having it available from the installer level is a minus, not a plus to the distro features.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The abstract action for the user is “become root - one way or another”.</p>
<p>It might be difficult to perfect the documentation because there are many different ways to install Debian.</p>
<ul>
<li>D-I (console looking old installer)</li>
<li>calamares (graphical installer coming with Debian Live)</li>
</ul>
<p>And two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>enable root account, set root password</li>
<li>don’t enable root account</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s at least 4 options.</p>
<p>So either su or sudo needs to be used (assuming that in some cases, Debian sets up sudo and add user “user” to group sudo by default).</p>
<p>If su cannot be used, just prepend all commands needing root (administative) rights with sudo. Or use <code>sudo su</code>.</p>

<p>Why TPM is important:</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.invisiblethings.org/2011/09/07/anti-evil-maid.html" class="inline-onebox">Anti Evil Maid | The Invisible Things Blog</a></p>
<p>Good point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use custom TPM SRK password (so, you did <em>not</em> pass -z to tpm_takeownership), then you can install Anti Evil Maid onto your regular boot partition.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are many very different ways to use a TPM. While a TPM has much less features than a CPU, a general feature request “use the TPM” is as useful as “make us of the CPU”. These topics should not be mixed.</p>
<p>This is mostly in a completely different context for TPM usage. Boot security / firmware security that utilizes TPM for messurements fortunately is unrelated to calamares. To accomplish <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Measured_boot">measured boot</a>, anti evil maid, fortunately no code in any Linux installer is required. This is based on boot firmware and operating system support.</p>
<p>Using a boot firmware and operating system that supports pressured boot, <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Verified_Boot">verified boot</a> which makes use of the TPM, might increase security. Using a TPM for transparent encryption however is completely different, optional feature, decision.</p>
<p>There is no general “use the TPM” feature which calamares could (or should) implement. Instead, very specific proposals on how to utilize the TPM could be written by developers for the purpose of increasesd security. Such features then, don’t necessarily (and hopefully) don’t need to be implemented at the calamares level, which I would hope to stay minimal.</p>
<p>A useful <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/image_formats#Goals">Goals</a> I support is:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The differences in the code base for Live Systems vs. Installer Systems vs. Installed Systems should be reduced as much as possible.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>So I want to provide a generic image for users to download. The image should be able to be flashed on an internal hard drive, a USB drive, on a server or anywhere else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then calamares would not even be required anymore. It’s a lot of engineering work ahead to get there and it’s not even clear if this can or will ever happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Installer specific code should be as minimal as possible.</li>
</ul>

<p>Good point to why use USB to unlock your PC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti Evil Maid on a separate USB stick rather than on your built-in disk boot partition. This is because you can use Anti Evil Maid as a provider of a keyfile to your LUKS disk encryption (as an additional file unsealable by the TPM). This way you could also stop adversary that is able to sniff your keystrokes (e.g. using hidden camera, or electromagnetic leak), and capture your disk decryption passphrase (see the discussion in the next section).</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Protection from an adversary that is sniffing full disk encryption passwords using cameras, doesn’t need require a TPM. Protection from that requires only an additional keyfile on USB. Keyfiles predate TPM.</p>
<p>It however doesn’t protect from an adversary that can sniff the full disk encryption password and steal the USB device including the keyfile. But a TPM won’t either.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any Linux installer that allows setting up password + keyfile on USB + backup keyfile on another USB. I would hope that there is no need to re-invent such a feature for every Linux installer and that this could instead abstracted into a general project.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that usability using cryptsetup, setting up keyfiles on USB is currently very bad. It is possible to do this manually but very difficult for users. I don’t know any Linux distribution solving that. But then again, there is no magic answer. And this problem also cannot be solved by saying “use the TPM (in calamare or anywhere)”.</p>
<p>Password + keyfile on USB would indeed protect against camera password sniffing + stealing of a powered off notebook.</p>
<p>However, that calamares TPM ticket <a href="https://github.com/calamares/calamares/issues/2355" class="inline-onebox">TPM Encryption support · Issue #2355 · calamares/calamares · GitHub</a> does not suggest that. It only suggests adding <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Transparent_Encryption">TPM Transparent Encryption</a> support. This is a security reduction. It is vulnerable to a new class of attacks: warm cold boot attacks. (As described in the wiki.) (Not to be confused with the “classic”, “normal” cold boot attacks.)</p>
<p>This is also the way which the Ubuntu installer allegedly can use the TPM for.</p>
<p>As the developer in that ticket pointed out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In any case an explanation of what the feature is, what it does, how it is used in Ubuntus, etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To make good use of a TPM for full disk encryption, it is important define adversary capabilities, the threat model. Added some of that here just now:<br>
<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Full_Disk_Encryption#TPM_Full_Disk_Encryption_Threat_Modeling">TPM Full Disk Encryption Threat Modeling</a></p>
<hr>
<p>As for using USB to unlock full disk encryption at boot that is great. (And no TPM required.)</p>
<p>But then is the question, use password + USB (more secure) or use USB only (less secure, more convenient)?</p>
<p>If that is a feature request, please open a separate forum thread for that.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Good point:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>use custom TPM SRK password (so, you did <em>not</em> pass -z to tpm_takeownership), then you can install Anti Evil Maid onto your regular boot partition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Good point to why use USB to unlock your PC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti Evil Maid on a separate USB stick rather than on your built-in disk boot partition. This is because you can use Anti Evil Maid as a provider of a keyfile to your LUKS disk encryption (as an additional file unsealable by the TPM). This way you could also stop adversary that is able to sniff your keystrokes (e.g. using hidden camera, or electromagnetic leak), and capture your disk decryption passphrase (see the discussion in the next section).</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Slight correction - I’ve been active in the open-source world since mid-April 2022, having gotten involved in Lubuntu early in the Kinetic Kudu release cycle. You can see some of my first bug fixing activity here: <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/calamares-settings-ubuntu/+bug/1966774" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Bug #1966774 “btrfs partioning with calamares results in unboota...” : Bugs : calamares-settings-ubuntu package : Ubuntu</a> But still, that’s not a whole lot of time, so you raise a valid concern and careful review is a very good idea. (Besides, I’m a human and make mistakes, and peer review helps keep those from getting into the finished product.)</p> ]]></description>
