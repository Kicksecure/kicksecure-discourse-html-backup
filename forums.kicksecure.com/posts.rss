        <title>3 big issues in Kicksecure 18 (my laptop is basically unusable now)</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Switching the Wayland compositor used by Kicksecure isn’t supported currently. Supporting a Wayland compositor is much more involved than supporting a window manager under X11, because the compositor is both the window manager <em>and</em> the display server. Of all the desktop environments in Kicksecure, LXQt was the only one light enough to be suitable for Kicksecure and that had mature enough Wayland support, and the best-supported compositor for LXQt is labwc, so that’s what we went with. (For similar reasons, switching the desktop environment entirely is also difficult.) This is likely the source of both the screen lock and keyboard layout issues.</p>
<p>That being said, labwc does support multiple workspaces. LXQt’s workspace switcher doesn’t work with them yet, but you can configure keyboard shortcuts for switching workspaces in <code>~/.config/labwc/rc.xml</code>. See <a href="https://labwc.github.io/labwc-config.5.html#workspaces" class="inline-onebox">labwc</a>.</p>
<p>The trackpad issue sounds like it may be a hardware problem that showed up by coincidence. We don’t do anything special to the touchpad config in Kicksecure. Hopefully a reinstall will fix it, but it sounds like you tried that without success. I’ve previously managed to fix a broken touchpad by opening the laptop, then removing and re-inserting the touchpad’s ribbon cable.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@Bobson5554]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <ol>
<li>
<p>I cannot run swaylock. I am using a gb keyboard layout (kinda, I will explain after) and have swaylock installed. When trying to install from the system maintenance panel, it said “Refusing to lock screen, because the correct screen locker cannot be determined. The XDG_SESSION_TYPE environment variable must be set to ‘x11’ or ‘wayland’ to determine the proper screen locker to use. However, XDG_SESSION_TYPE is currently set to ‘tty’. Please report this bug!“ I ran “XDG_SESSION_TYPE=wayland”. Still doesn’t work.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>The reason why I say I am kinda on gb is because I set gb in the install and it worked originally, but I think that after changing to kwin, it went to US, my /etc/vconsole.conf says gb, but it is still US.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is what is said when I did the keyboard config option in configuration center and keyboard layout.<br>
00:00:00.000 [../src/main.c:72] LABWC_PID not set<br>
set_labwc_keymap: WARNING: ‘labwc --reconfigure’ reconfiguration failed!<br>
set_labwc_keymap: INFO: new ‘/home/user/.config/labwc/environment’ contents:<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_LAYOUT=gb<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_VARIANT=<br>
XKB_DEFAULT_OPTIONS=<br>
set_labwc_keymap: INFO: Configuration success.</p>
<p>Btw, the reason I changed to kwin instead of labwc, is because I really like having workspaces, but I couldn’t have workspaces without it. When I put desktop switcher in my pannel it shows “n/a”</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>My trackpad isn’t working. I have no idea if this is because of kicksecure 18, but randomly it just stopped working, I was configuring kicksecure fine and my trackpad was working. (At this point swaylock worked) I went to do something, and when I came back it said someething along the lines of screenlock broken, go to terminal with ctrl+shift+f2. I shutdown, and after turning it on, my mouse didn’t move. I tried to reflash kicksecure and it still didn’t work, even during the install process and after too. I have been using a mouse plugged into my laptop. But I am sharing with my PC, this is really annoying.</li>
</ol>
<p>I would really appreciate some support, I can barely use my laptop right now. If I can go back to xfce, that would also work. Thanks.</p>

</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I bet this is because you have LVM between your filesystem and LUKS. The current LUKS detector  I believe requires the filesystem to be used <em>directly</em> on the LUKS volume, not with LVM between it. Fixing that might be possible, but right now LVM support in Kicksecure is pretty limited (mainly because we can’t get an installer that supports LVM; we had debian-installer support for a while but had to remove it due to security issues in live-build when downloading debian-installer.)</p>
<p>If instead of installing from the Debian netinstaller, you install from a Debian Live LXQt image, does it work any better? That will let you use LUKS without LVM.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Warning: Prob. with installing on Verbatim SeaGlass drives - False alarm</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@CodeLurker]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks for your help.  I don’t think it’s that.  It happened on the brand new SeaGlass drives, and the old Sandisk.  I haven’t found one that had the read-only set, that I wasn’t able to reformat one way or another, e.g. by writing all zeros to, and burn Tails or other ISO to.  Why would it happen with all the brand new drives except one, evidently intermittently on all, and intermittently on a known good old SanDisk?  I’ve never gotten an error while burning, except when it tries tries to install the bootloader.  I know it’s not a lot to go on, but I also am not the only one this keeps happening to (e.g. similar posts for other thumb drive capable distros).</p>
<p>I suspect a multi-distro wide problem with the boot config, e.g. an uninitialized variable prob.  Then again, I suspect there are many of you that it works reliably for; which might suggest a hardware issue.  However, it could also be that I have some hardware that the install has a buggy driver for, that others don’t.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thank you for the reply, much appreciated. Tried again on a Trixie install from yesterday.</p>
<p>After entering passphrase to unencrypt I get two lines from swapfile creator</p>
<p>Info: swapfile creator….</p>
<p>Info: File /var/swapfile on LUKS encrypted device: ‘no’. - Doing nothing, ok.</p>
<p>encryption worked on bare Trixie but not after kicksecure.</p>
<p>Does setting up/not setting up root during Trixie install have any impact on kicksecure install? I followed all the steps in the notes right. But after switching to root before K18 install im not 100% sure it’s right as I get root /home/user# and the echo PATH don’t match the full path ( like in notes). Could all be wrong but just asking anyways.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>It’s hard to determine what’s going wrong here without knowing the exact error messages. Sometimes the same thing can fail the same way with two different error messages, and the details of those error messages indicate radically different solutions needed for each case, so it’s very helpful if you share the exact error messages you’re seeing, if any. (Detailed step-by-step instructions to reproduce an issue are also useful.)</p>
<p>What’s the LUKS swap file issue? What error message are you being shown?</p>
<p>Similarly, what’s the error message you’re running into with security-misc?</p>
<p>For the issue with graphical login, try logging in at a CLI login prompt, then run <code>/usr/libexec/desktop-config-dist/start-lxqt-session</code>. This is the command usually used “under the hood” to start LXQt. What error messages, if any, does this show? Or does it give you an LXQt desktop?</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@GaS58Bc]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hey all, nooby question (eventually <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face.png?v=14" title=":grinning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20">) so apologies if I’ve asked wrong.</p>
<p>Been trying to morph K18 on Trixie usb. Failed 4-5 times so far. Having fun though and learning stuff <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face.png?v=14" title=":grinning_face:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p>
<p>Tried two different fast 1tb usbs, one with lvm encryption and one just lvm, no encryption. Used rufus and etcher.</p>
<p>Trixie installs every time with just lxqt and Debian desktop environment. I follow the guide add the repo manually as not in extrepo for Trixie, then I run into issues once I reboot after installing K18.</p>
<p>On first usb (A) bugs out after entering encryption password, asks for user login then fails to load lxqt and returns cli - don’t know how to start lxqt from cli. Or I run into lux swap file issue and no cli and no options. On second usb (B) K18 install failed as it couldn’t install security-misc and reported process error. Cli option to fix doesn’t fix. When I reboot it’s just into Trixie.</p>
<p>I’m trying to discount my Trixie install choices as a factor.</p>
<p>Question = Are there any dos/dont on the Trixie install which will screw up the k18 morph?</p>
<p>Thanks for reading and any tips.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Also Polkit still supports <code>.pkla</code> but is moving towards javascript format for rules now in Debian Trixie other modern systems like Fedora. So that Javscript syntax should be used for format to use for rules.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Does sysmaint-split fully disable polkit for user or just the pkexec calls?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>polkit isn’t completely disabled, but it isn’t just pkexec that is disabled either. Anything that pops up a Polkit authorization prompt via <code>/usr/lib/polkit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1</code> won’t work, because <code>polkit-agent-helper-1</code> is SUID-root and has thus been walled off into the <code>sysmaint</code> account. If polkit authorization works without popping up an auth prompt though, that should still work.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Yes, those are the ones I was thinking of were the discrete GPU’s, the ones you install in the PCIe slots. Lots of security risks with them hence why Qubes disables them and only allows integrated.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi Patrick,</p>
<p>I was able to run GUI of both Gparted and GSmartControl using the command from the documentation you mentioned:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>sudo --set-home XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR application-name</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But I couldn’t succeed with <em>lxsudo application-name</em> despite it is also mentioned in the same documentation.</p>
<p>This:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>lxsudo gparted</p>
</blockquote>
<p>returns “Authorization required, but no authorization protocol defined” and a Gtk-WARNING mentioning ‘cannot open display’</p>
<p>Edit: it’s weird, the above lxsudo command has  disappeared… probably because the documentation has just been edited few minutes after my post above</p> ]]></description>

<p>By the way, is there a way to check the integrity of kicksecure implementation after the installation process? I couldn’t find it before and now tried to search for it with no good results either.  (The <code>cat /etc/*_version</code> shows versions anyways. even without <code>-server</code> package.) Not a simple package check list, but things that were implemented, if they currently done or undone for whatever reason(malfunction of some kind etc).</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Some default apps in K18 just can&#39;t work</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@cookie.monster]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>I’m a happy user of Kicksecure 17, but since major release 18 is out I feel a bit frustrated as some things that worked before simply don’t anymore.</p>
<p>Give you a couple of examples:</p>
<p>The system tools GParted and GSmartControl can’t work any more due to the higher privileges required.</p>
<p>Even after removing sysmaint account they don’t work. I do understand it’s related to privleap and Wayland, but unfortunately I am not skilled enough to find a way to ‘fix’ this.</p>
<p>I’m really concerned as my threat model also implies I use KVM in live mode host and ZuluCrypt, where both required higher privileges.</p>
<p>Any suggestion to make all these apps with higher privileges to work?</p>
<p>B/R</p>

<p>But it’s not simply just tor, it’s also the sdwdate and many other little things that in combine bring lots of issues.</p>

<p>You can use <code>dummy-dependency</code> to remove those too.</p>

<p>So if I do wanna remove it - there’s simply no way to do it(with keeping up with updates etc)???</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Not a <em>simple</em> way, but as explained above there is <em>a</em> way. <code>dummy-dependency</code> can be used to remove anything even if other packages depend on it. Anything you consider unnecessary, you can remove, including <code>tor</code>, <code>sdwdate</code>, etc. It might cause other things that depend on a remove component to malfunction, but if that occurs, you can reinstall the component in question (or uninstall the malfunctioning components). For instance, removing sdwdate will cause issues with sdwdate-gui, but you can remove sdwdate-gui too.</p>
<p>There have been requests to create a minimal variant of Kicksecure, but the demand isn’t high enough for us to commit to maintaining it (it would likely entail at least another seven images to support, maybe more).</p> ]]></description>
