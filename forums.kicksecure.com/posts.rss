        <title>Question about IPv6</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@ricardo.martinez]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hey everyone! I am not sure if this the best place to post this, so if it is not, sorry in advance.</p>
<p>I am trying to configure reticulum which is a new kind of decentralized network and it auto connects over IPv6 to other nodes on the network.</p>
<p>When I checked if IPv6 was enabled in Kicksecure, it says it is not.</p>
<p>Reading the docs, I found this on the DNS security page:<br>
/wiki/DNS_Security</p>
<p>" * The user’s computer has a local IPv6 but no actual IPv6 connectivity which might confuse DNS resolvers such as <code>unbound</code>."</p>
<p>My question is: is it safe to enable IPv6?</p>
<p>Why is turned off by default, and should I take any additional security/privacy measures if I decide to enable it?</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Question about grub-live and writable file system</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>The current live mode detection code isn’t Veracrypt-volume aware, so it can’t tell the difference between a container located on an ephemeral live filesystem, and a container located on a writable disk device. It just sees that you have a writable mounted device and warns you about it.</p>
<p>It might be possible to add code that is aware of Veracrypt volumes, but that would only make it work with Veracrypt specifically. There are a lot of applications that may mount a writable container that our code would have to be aware of, so in general this isn’t an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>If the container itself is located on an ephemeral filesystem, then your writes to it should disappear on reboot, just like with any file on the ephemeral filesystem.</p> ]]></description>

<p>It depends on how promptly the Debian kernel backporters update the kernel. The backported kernel doesn’t get official security support from Debian to my awareness like the stable kernel does, but people use backports kernels to I assume they’re maintained.</p>

</aside>
<p>It probably won’t. We’re using kernels directly from Debian’s repository, and Debian won’t be upgrading past Linux 6.1 in Bookworm (instead, they will backporting bug and security fixes to the older kernel as appropriate). However, a significantly newer kernel will be present by default in Kicksecure 18, which will be based on Debian Trixie.</p>

        <title>About new Kernel</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@InTheAir]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi.</p>
<p>I’m installing kicksecure in a new laptop. The network wasn’t working and I’ve tried installing drivers but no luck. The only thing that has worked is installing a different version of the kernel and now the wifi is working fine.</p>
<p>For the installation of the new kernel I’ve followed this:<br>
kicksecure(.)com/wiki/Kernel#Package_Installation</p>
<p>Now this command <code>uname -r</code> give me this: <code>6.12.38+deb12-amd64</code></p>
<p>The questions:<br>
Is this system secure or is more vulnerable?<br>
When kicksecure will use this kernel in the stable repository?<br>
Should I now remove this file: /etc/apt/sources.list.d/backports.list ?<br>
I think not, but I guess that I should remove it only when the kernel I need is in the stable repository…</p>
<p>Thanks</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>No problem, it is a significant departure from the old behavior and I can definitely see how it can be confusing. (We changed how the live indicator worked too since the old one was Xfce-specific and we wanted a desktop-agnostic indicator instead, so that’s why the indicator moved.)

<p>There is no LIVE indicator in the top-right as I was accustomed to seeing, is there another indicator for which mode it has booted in other than in the top right?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Could you share a screenshot of the Whonix-Gateway virtual machine in this state? We recently added a feature to Whonix-Gateway where the system maintenance panel will appear upon login in user sessions if user-sysmaint-split isn’t installed on the gateway. By default, user-sysmaint-split is <em>not</em> installed on the gateway, so you <em>should</em> see the system maintenance panel on the gateway even when booting into “LIVE Mode | USER Session”. (This does look awfully similar to “PERSISTENT Mode | SYSMAINT Session”, but it’s not the same thing.)</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Okay, so I have also tried just importing fresh appliance again (stable 17.4.4.6 .ova) and trying to run Live User Session mode without running any updates and it still goes directly into System Maintenance mode with the gateway virtual machine.

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>I updated my Whonix Gateway (VirtualBox) today and upon rebooting, Live mode was no longer an option to choose from.</p>
<p>I took a look at the /etc/grub.d/10_20_linux_live to see if I could spot anything that might’ve broken, but I didn’t notice anything wrong.</p>
<p>I decided to start fresh by importing the .ova file for the newest version (17.4.4.6, stable). However, upon booting and performing an update in system maintenance mode, trying to reboot and choose the Live User Session mode seems to open System Maintenance mode with persistence each time.</p>
<p>I’ve already deleted my old appliance for this fresh copy of the gateway and workstation. I’m not sure how to proceed. I’m not a developer or power user, but if there is any way I can help to figure out what’s happened, please advise.</p>
<p>Best regards,<br>
Jake</p>
<p>EDIT:  Have tried a reinstall of grub-live (‘sudo apt install --reinstall --no-install-recommends grub-live’) but no improvement, it still boots into Sysmaint with persistence when choosing Live User Session.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: **Adding here for others reference, it was actually booting into Live mode as arraybolt3 explains in their response, I just got confused by the system maintenance panel showing on boot and had expected to see the word Live in the top right. **</p> ]]></description>

<li>perf(permission-hardener): optimize string match. Replace subprocess grep calls with bash substring matching in check_nosuid_whitelist function. This eliminates ~10k unneeded subprocess spawns that were causing significant performance degradation. In testing, it improves overall script execution speed by an order of magnitude. (Thanks to Ashlen!)</li>
<li>fix(permission-hardener): add exactwhitelist permissions for ssh-agent. (Thanks to Ashlen!)</li>
<li>fix(permission-hardener): ssh-agent gets 755 perms. Replace the commented-out matchwhitelist entry for ssh-agent with an explicit permission entry (755) for /usr/bin/ssh-agent. When ssh-agent’s matchwhitelist entry was commented out in commit 7a5f8b87af, permission-hardener began resetting it to restrictive defaults (744), preventing non-root users from executing ssh-agent. This broke split SSH functionality in Qubes OS for me because I was using Kicksecure in the vault qube, and ssh-agent runs under a non-root user in that configuration (see <a href="https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/split-ssh/19060" class="inline-onebox">Split SSH - Community Guides - Qubes OS Forum</a>. As noted in the comment, Debian installs with 2755 permissions as a way to mitigate ptrace attacks, but this rationale doesn’t apply due to kernel.yama.ptrace_scope=2 being set in Kicksecure.

###<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> The problem you're addressing (if any)

Right now any boot modes advertised by a template will be visible for both that template and any AppVMs derived from it. This might not make sense for all boot modes - Kicksecure would like to implement an "unrestricted admin" boot mode that removes the user-sysmaint-split package during early boot to allow the user full `sudo` access for that boot only. This would take advantage of the fact that rebooting an AppVM resets most of its root filesystem to make this change temporary, so that users can switch between safe and unrestricted modes. This boot mode only makes sense for AppVMs, it would be detrimental for a Kicksecure template to be booted in this way.

### The solution you'd like

Add another boot mode qvm feature class, `boot-mode.restrict.(boot-mode-name)`, which can be set to either `AppVM` or `TemplateVM`. The boot mode will then be restricted to that VM type (i.e. if the feature is set to `AppVM`, that boot mode will only be available for AppVMs, not TemplateVMs).

This could potentially be made more flexible by allowing the feature to be set to a comma-separated list of the VM types the boot mode should be supported in (AppVM, TemplateVM, DispVM, RemoteVM, etc.), but I fear that might cause problems because of the presence of AppVM default boot modes. If a template sets a boot mode that isn't supported by DispVMs as the AppVM default boot mode, what should a DispVM based upon that template do? Thus why I believe this should only allow two restriction choices. "AppVM" in the context of this option really would only mean "anything other than a TemplateVM". Perhaps the wording should be adjusted accordingly, not sure.

The only problem I can see 

### The value to a user and who that user might be

Less confusing in the user interface, users won't see boot modes that they shouldn't be using.

(This is somewhat of a followup to a<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> conversation I had with Demi and Marek in the Qubes OS Matrix room.)

Currently, Qubes OS allows booting a Qube with special kernel command line parameters by using a special cli-only feature (sadly I can't remember the name of the tool used for this). If you don't do this, each qube is simply booted with some default command-line parameters, which are sufficient to allow the VM to boot and be usable. Thus far, this has been good enough, since each OS booted in Qubes generally doesn't have multiple boot modes that need to be supported.

With the introduction of the [user-sysmaint-split](https://github.com/kicksecure/user-sysmaint-split) feature into Kicksecure and Whonix, things have changed somewhat. As a form of defense-in-depth on top of the security Qubes and Kicksecure already provide, Kicksecure will soon offer a package (really a set of packages) that will allow separating user and root responsibilities much more strongly than usually done. The current implementation uses file permissions on the `sudo` and `pkexec` executables that makes them only able to be run by a special `sysmaint` user, which is locked by default and cannot be signed into normally. This makes `sudo` and `pkexec` completely unable to be run during a normal user session, greatly reducing the risk of a root compromise. To gain access to the `sysmaint` account, the user must physically reboot the machine and select "PERSISTENT mode SYSMAINT" from the list of boot options - doing so triggers a systemd unit that unlocks and automatically logs into the sysmaint account. For added security, most if not all non-essential services are suppressed while booted into sysmaint mode, and a very minimal desktop named [sysmaint-panel](https://github.com/kicksecure/sysmaint-panel) is provided to discourage the user from launching potentially dangerous applications like Firefox while in this mode. Users can run privileged commands even when not booted into sysmaint mode through an SUID-less privilege escalation framework called [privleap](https://github.com/Kicksecure/privleap).

This is all well and good, but right now this only works on physical hardware and traditional virtual machines (virt-manager, VirtualBox), because it requires the user to be able to boot into "sysmaint mode", which requires access to a GRUB console. Qubes VMs don't usually even use GRUB (since they share the dom0 kernel which is directly booted by Xen), and even when they do for some reason, you don't get access to the console during bootup unless you're using an HVM. This puts Qubes OS users in a bit of a sticky spot if they want to take advantage of the features offered by user-sysmaint-split. In UX terms, basically the end result is that `sudo` and `pkexec` become permanently unusable, and to get root access the user has to open up a root console either via `qvm-run` (which is dangerous because of X11) or via the "Open console in qube" feature of Qube Manager (which is secure and neat but also slow and somewhat difficult to use). Most of the "nice bits" of user-sysmaint-split are not accessible. In addition, Kicksecure templates will *also* be basically "locked down" by this, making it tricky to make changes or install software in the templates without resorting to one of the above solutions. Only AppVMs really need `sudo` and `pkexec` locked down, ideally a Kicksecure template should have full root access out of the box.

Last but not least, Qubes OS only supports specifying custom kernel parameters for a qube if that qube shares dom0's kernel. If you use a VM-internal kernel, you can't set the kernel parameters because those are hardcoded into a GRUB config file within the qube. This is a problem since Kicksecure has some interest in using qube-internal kernels by default, and obviously users may want to use custom kernels or the like without losing the ability to control (or even use) user-sysmaint-split.

### The solution you'd like

The solution I have in mind here isn't really one solution, but rather a set of them that fixes all of the paper cuts here:

* Templates should be able to specify auxiliary kernel parameters that Qubes OS should use when booting them and AppVMs based on them. Each template should be able to specify more than one set of kernel parameters, one per boot mode it supports.
* These boot modes should somehow be exposed to the end user. How exactly this should look I'm unclear on - an easy solution would be to provide a drop-down in Qube Manager's settings window that would allow selecting the boot mode the VM should use on next bootup. A potentially more usable solution would be to integrate the boot modes into the application menu somehow, but this could overcomplicate the user interface and might also be a massive pain to implement.
* Templates should be able to specify the default boot mode for themselves and the default boot mode for derived AppVMs separately. This way the Kicksecure template could be set up so that it would boot in sysmaint mode by default, while AppVMs would be booted in user mode by default. This would allow the Kicksecure template to be used in an intuitive fashion similar to most existing templates.
* There should be some way to boot a VM with dom0-specified kernel parameters *even if* you're booting using a qube-internal kernel. Demi, Marek, and I had a pretty long discussion about how this could be done, ultimately it seems that pvgrub is the best tool to use for this, but will need some extra features for it to work.
* In a perfect world, the user should be able to define their own boot modes. That would make this rather complex suite of features be useful for much more than just Kicksecure and Whonix.

None of this is set in stone, I'm definitely open to alternate ways of implementing things that would be easier. This is obviously a very large list of features, which I intend to contribute or at least help contribute.

### The value to a user and who that user might be

user-sysmaint-split will work really, really nicely in Qubes OS. Additionally, with the ability to specify auxiliary kernel parameters in templates, Kicksecure and Whonix could use the extensive hardening parameters they use on the desktop within Qubes as well. Users who need or want to tweak their kernels and kernel config will also have much more freedom to do so, which could benefit Qubes OS devs as well as highly advanced users.

<p>One could say, it’s easy for a physical attacker to re-enable dracut recovery console using a kernel parameter change - which is even documented - hence defeating the purpose. That is correct - at time of writing. Protecting the kernel command line is the job of verified boot. Related:</p>

        <title>Sdwdate design enhancements</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Not sure there’s much to discuss here, this is just me doing a brain-dump of my research so that it’s not lost and so that others can comment on it as desirable.</p>
<p>The current iteration of sdwdate does a pretty good job of keeping the system’s clock accurate but skewed just enough to provide better anonymity under Whonix. However, it has a few shortcomings we’d like to resolve:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only sets the time for the (virtual) machine it runs on, it isn’t able to act as a server for helping other virtual machines running on the same system to also synchronize their time securely. This is something that would be nice to fix in Qubes OS, allowing sys-whonix (or more likely, sys-ops-whonix once that exists) to act as a master time-keeper for all VMs.</li>
<li>The current way it adjusts the clock is somewhat awful - it does a large clock jump or two to get the time close enough to accurate to allow connecting to Tor, then does a large number of small clock jumps to get the time to a final “good” value. Clock jump confuse software in multiple ways, and the small clock jumps we do currently can result in systemd journal being flooded, so they’re best avoided, and if they’re needed, it’s best to do one clock jump and then slew the clock to the correct time using something like <code>adjtimex</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core sdwdate code is good and should probably not change too much. What should probably change is the <code>sclockadj</code> tool that is used for doing small clock jumps, and we need a way to allow sdwdate to provide time values for other VMs to sync themselves to.</p>
<hr>
<p>The below is my research into using adjtimex, The tl;dr: is that <strong>we probably should not use adjtimex for initial clock synchronization after boot, but it may be usable to keep the clock in sync thereafter.</strong></p>
<p>Properly adjusting a clock using <code>adjtime</code> or <code>adjtimex</code> (slewing it to the correct value using in-kernel support) is very, very slow. According to <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/188620/535873" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">time - How long will NTP take to adjust the clock if it doesn't immediately set it? - Unix &amp; Linux Stack Exchange</a> it takes approximately 4.17 minutes to adjust the clock by 128 milliseconds, or at least it did in 2015. In my testing with adjtimex, this is still approximately correct - it appears that adjtimex adjusts the clock by 500 microseconds per second. This means it takes a little over 33 minutes to adjust the clock by one second.</p>
<p>The problem with this is that Tor (and therefore sdwdate) only allow us to resolve time to within a second at best because that’s the resolution of the HTTP headers we get. On top of that, we get the time from three different servers at once when using sdwdate and then go with the median value of those three times, meaning that in practice we’re not going to be within a second of accuracy because of network lag and all sorts of other things NTP is designed to work around and Tor isn’t. On top of that, we also randomize the clock a bit for greater anonymity, meaning that we might change the clock several seconds on each invocation of sdwdate. When it takes over half an hour to move the clock by one second, making a multi-second change will take <em>hours</em>. Now if we assume that the system’s clock is fairly accurate, and we only ever have <em>one</em> time randomization offset per session (generated randomly each session but never changed until the next reboot, I guess), we can probably skew the clock by a second or two on each sdwdate invocation without too much trouble. But if the network is shaky (for instance, the user is using cellular internet in bad conditions), it’s likely sdwdate will be trying to make much larger changes.</p>
<p>(Note, anecdotally it seems that sdwdate doesn’t see any particular need to change the clock in my KVM virtual machine when I restart sdwdate, at least while my network is working well. The median time difference keeps being 0. That being said, other time differences were frequently reported that were not the median, so I assume that users won’t always get this lucky.)</p>
<p>The current <code>sclockadj</code> code adjusts the clock by 5 million nanoseconds per second. This is <em>ten times</em> faster than adjtimex, which adjusts by 5 hundred thousand nanoseconds per second. Thus sclockadj can handle multi-second adjustments without too much grief, but only by doing clock jumps. Switching to clock slewing with adjtimex will slow down our time adjustments very much.</p>
<p>The 500 microseconds per second adjustment rate is not configurable, it is unfortunately hardcoded in the kernel’s NTP code, which the <code>adjtimex</code> system call uses to do its work of slewing the clock. There isn’t any way to do a “fast slew” to my awareness, unless we want to try to contribute a feature for this to the kernel (which… might be possible?).</p>
<p>Based on the above, I think we might get away with using adjtimex to keep the clock in sync once it is initially synchronized. For making an adjustment of a second or two, it’s probably enough. But on first boot, when the clock is most likely to be several seconds slow or fast (especially on machines with no BIOS battery or a broken battery), we probably need to just use a clock jump. This is similar to the behavior of ntpd.</p>
<hr>
<p>For making sdwdate able to act as a server under Qubes OS, there are a couple of issues to deal with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Qubes OS currently synchronizes all VMs to dom0’s time, at least when resuming after suspend. But we would like for dom0 to be able to synchronize itself to sys-(ops-)whonix also.</li>
<li>Every VM on the system should ideally have slightly different time, and should get their time values from a different sdwdate time sync invocation (to avoid one bad sync affecting all VMs on the system).</li>
</ul>
<p>To work with the first issue, we can simply have all VMs (including sys-(ops-)whonix) blindly trust dom0’s time to begin with. Once a successful sdwdate sync is done however, the VM should record how its time differs from dom0’s time. Then, on resume-from-suspend, the VM can take the time given to it by dom0, and adjust it by the offset before syncing the clock. Any time dom0’s clock changed, it would have to announce this to all running VMs so they could recalculate their offsets from dom0.</p>
<p>To work around the second issue, we need some way for a virtual machine to get “whatever the current time is +/- some fixed offset” each time they synchronize their clock with the ClockVM. The fixed offset should be unique per-machine and per-boot, but should be constant between boots to avoid needing lots of clock jumps forward and backward. To acheive this, the client process that gets the time from the ClockVM should create a random identifier on launch, and present that identifier to sdwdate every time it syncs the clock. When sdwdate sees an identifier it hasn’t seen previously, it should generate a new random offset, but if it sees an identifier it’s seen previously, it should use the same offset it presented last time. This way each VM can have its time a little bit different, but that “little bit different” will be static for each virtual machine (until the client VM or ClockVM is rebooted, at least).</p>
<p>We don’t have to tack a bunch of code onto the existing sdwdate code base in order to make it able to act like a server. We should just create a new server process that serves whatever the ClockVM’s current time is (+/- the fixed offset described earlier) to clients. This probably won’t be very difficult to do at all. We will need this server process to NOT serve time until after sdwdate has synced the clock, but thankfully sdwdate already reports its status to other processes on the same VM, so we can rely on that.</p> ]]></description>

<p>I don’t believe so. That documentation explicitly warns that one way to be able to switch virtual terminals is to:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…be running under a user account that has logged in at a virtual terminal already. In this … instance, software running as the logged-in user could <em>switch</em> to a different virtual terminal, but it would not be able to attempt to login at that terminal. That would require read/write access to the virtual terminal that was switched to. Virtual terminals that have a login prompt are only able to be read from and written to by root or a person with physical access to the machine.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The reason this is a problem in the context of a SAK is that even if we switch to a TTY presenting an authentic login screen, malware could immediately switch us back to the TTY it was on a second ago and display a fake login screen. It’s not a danger when it comes to logging into other accounts, it is a problem when it comes to stealing user data.</p>
<p>(Worthy of note, once we switch to Wayland, the compositor will almost certainly run as a user other than root, and thus the TTY it runs on will have its permissions set to a non-root user. Thus this issue will start affecting graphical sessions as well, not just text-only VT logins. I think though that’s a small price to pay, especially since there’s a mitigation.)</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Based on some quick testing using the fsfreeze technique described in an earlier shared link, it looks like it is <em>not</em> possible to immunize a process to SIGKILL or SIGSTOP by using a stuck thread.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto"># Set up
mkdir stickyfs
fallocate -l 8M sticky.img
mkfs.ext4 sticky.img
sudo mount sticky.img stickyfs
sudo chmod 777 stickyfs

# Write a simple multithreaded C program that will get one thread stuck
cat &lt;&lt;EOF &gt; test.c
#include &lt;pthread.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;errno.h&gt;

void *sticky_func(void *arg) {
  const char *stuckstr = "I'm stuck, help!\n";
  int stuckfd = open("stickyfs/sticky.txt", O_RDWR | O_CREAT);
  write(stuckfd, stuckstr, strlen(stuckstr));
}

int main() {
  pthread_t sticky;
  pthread_create(&amp;sticky, NULL, sticky_func, NULL);
  int i = 0;
  while (1) {
    printf("%d\n", i++);
  }
}
EOF

gcc test.c

# Lock the stickyfs filesystem
sudo fsfreeze -f stickyfs

# Run the newly created application
./a.out

# Numbers will scroll down the screen indicating that the process is doing something. Open another terminal to do other work in.

# Look at the contents of stickyfs, verify sticky.txt does not exist there
ls stickyfs

# Find the PID of the sticky process
pgrep a.out

# SIGSTOP it
kill -s SIGSTOP PID

# Observe the numbers stop scrolling down the screen
# Resume the process
kill -s SIGCONT PID

# Observe the numbers start scrolling again
# Kill the process with SIGKILL
kill -s SIGKILL PID

# Observe the numbers stop scroling, but the process does not fully exit, confirming that it is stuck in a kernel thread
# Unfreeze the stickyfs dir
sudo fsfreeze -u stickyfs

# Observe the process exits now
</code></pre>
<p>So it looks like SIGSTOP is usable here. Even though the stuck thread isn’t responding to the signals, the unstuck threads that could actually be dangerous are still affected by those signals.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>On the topic of a secure attention key, someone in 2016 posted a really nice overview of attack scenarios where a SAK is very useful: <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/sak-sas-secure-attention-key-sequence-on-linux.1325235/#post-31739583" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">SAK/SAS - Secure attention key sequence on Linux | Ars OpenForum</a> Quoting the post:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s not about a machine we don’t trust; that’s a separate but valid concern. It’s about a computer that multiple people have access to, e.g. libraries, computer labs, workplaces. Many people may be allowed on that machine, but each having their own accounts and passwords.</p>
<p>Attack type number 1:<br>
Attacker logs into his account and starts up a full-screen program that looks and acts identical to the login screen. (Program designed to collect the username/password data and store it or send it somewhere, then shows a fictitious error screen or simply logs out or reboots or hangs so that someone forces a restart.)<br>
Victim finds an apparently unused workstation. Logs in. Game over.</p>
<p>Attack type number 2:<br>
Victim logs in, starts up some programs, opens some files, then locks the screen and goes for a coffee break.<br>
Attacker hard-resets the machine, logs in and runs a similar program that looks/behaves like the screenlocker instead.<br>
Victim returns and attempts to unlock the screen. Game over.</p>
<p>Attack type number 3:<br>
Victim forgets to lock screen on going to the john. (When you gotta go…)<br>
Attacker runs fake screenlocker on the Victim’s own acct.<br>
Victim returns and either forgot that he didn’t lock it or figures it timed out from inactivity. Unlocks screen. Game over. (program simply terminates itself putting him back at his desktop after having sent the password over the internet and deleting its tracks)<br>
Some compromise existed already, since Victim failed to lock, but this attack provides stealthy expansion of that gap, allowing future log on, not just a one time access, and also gives you any sudo privileges the account has.</p>
<p>Having a SAK that users are trained to ALWAYS enter before passwords eliminates the risk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the features Windows has bound to the three finger salute is triggering the lock screen or login screen to function (the screen displays even before that, but the SAK signals it to prompt for the password), which conveniently solves all of these issues. To implement something like this on Linux, we could probably do something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>The screen locker itself doesn’t accept a password, it simply listens for a privileged process to give it an “unlock the screen” signal and unlocks the screen upon receipt of that signal.</li>
<li>Pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del causes emerg-shutdown (which probably needs renamed at this point) to freeze all user accounts on the system, send the user to an unused TTY, and display a greetd+wlgreet window. The user can then log in with their user name and password.</li>
<li>The script that runs on login signals emerg-shutdown to unfreeze the system, then looks to see if the user is already logged in (and if so, on which TTY). If the user is already logged in, the script instructs emerg-shutdown to unlock that user’s TTY, then it switches to that user’s TTY and is done. If the user is not already logged in, a new login is created.</li>
</ul>
<p>This mitigates all three attack scenarios. As for how to implement this and the emergency session at the same time, we just need emerg-shutdown to be able to tell whether or not the active TTY is locked (this can be done most likely with the help of the custom screen locker). If the TTY is locked, the salute will trigger a login/unlock action like described above, otherwise it will trigger an emergency session like described earlier.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Ctrl+Alt+Del (three-finger salute) action</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Had a conversation about how this could work with Patrick, this is my current set of ideas/plans after that conversation.</p>
<p>We have the <code>emerg-shutdown</code> background process now, which among other things monitors all keystrokes on the system by grabbing the /dev/input/event* devices on startup. This is done so that if the user presses a panic key combination (user configurable, the default is yet to be determined, see <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/emergency-key-press-shutdown-sequence/1199" class="inline-onebox">Emergency key press shutdown sequence</a>), the system can be immediately and forcibly shut down, without any possibility of malicious interference or accidental overriding. That same mechanism could be used in theory to listen for any key combination though, allowing us to define keyboard shortcuts that talk to a privileged component of the system (similar to the Secure Attention Key in other operating systems). Another advantage of this is that it’s not possible for malware to access this interface unless it is running as root, because emulated input mechanisms allow communicating with the display server, not the kernel’s evdev driver. Injecting key events into the kernel’s evdev subsystem requires using uinput, which requires root privileges to access, thus unprivileged malware can’t send keystroke combinations in order to trigger whatever privileged actions are configured here.</p>
<p>Since shortcuts configured in emerg-shutdown require either root privileges or physical access to the machine to trigger, this makes it seem like the perfect place to implement a Ctrl+Alt+Delete handler. The question then becomes, what should this handler do?</p>
<p>There are two possible directions we could take this. One is the simple route - register the salute in emerg-shutdown, and send a DBus message to whatever user session is on an active TTY in response. Those messages would then instruct an agent running as the user to do something like start a task manager or lock the screen. This would be useful, but it would only be marginally better than just defining a keyboard shortcut in the user session. It wouldn’t allow the user to kill applications that are running as root or as a different user (something they may have a legitimate reason to do even in a user session), and it wouldn’t prevent anything “going wrong” in the user session (a malicious or runaway process, for instance) from being able to interfere with the salute’s functionality in some way.</p>
<p>The other, more complex route, would be to switch to an “emergency session” of sorts, moving the user to an unused TTY and launching a graphical session in that TTY where they can do things as root or another privileged user. This is far more powerful, <em>and</em> possibly far more secure if done right.</p>
<p>The more complex solution is unsafe under X11 because of the world-writable UNIX sockets created by X11, exposing attack surface that could result in exploitable escalation of privilege vulnerabilities. Under Wayland however, the display server’s socket is generally under /run/user/UID, which has strict permissions to prevent access by other users, so as long as the kernel’s permission subsystem holds up, this shouldn’t be an issue. We can thus run a separate Wayland server as a privileged user (such as <code>sysmaint</code>) alongside an unprivileged and untrusted user session, without as much fear of vulnerabilities. (If running a full Wayland server sounds like too much risk, we could also use a raw framebuffer. Qt supports rendering directly to a framebuffer, it’s very slow at least under a virtual machine, but it works. I think this is overkill though, and it will also make it hard to work with multiple programs at once, which would almost certainly be desirable.)</p>
<p>One danger of an emergency UI such as this is that it’s not impossible for a malicious application to prevent the user from escaping to the emergency session. The emergency session would simply run in a TTY (since that’s the only feature Linux has for this sort of thing), and it would be fairly trivial for malware running as a user in a graphical session to simply force the user back to the original TTY, using a console file descriptor. (One can switch the active TTY to any other TTY if they have write access to any one TTY. In other words, if the user is logged in graphically and thus /dev/tty7 is writable by them, malware running as that user can open /dev/tty7 and then switch the user to any desired TTY.) To prevent this, one solution would be to SIGSTOP potentially malicious processes, specifically those which run as a logged-in user. This cannot be done to every process in the system though, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>PID 1 cannot be SIGSTOP’d (I tried, the signal was silently ignored)</li>
<li>A SIGSTOP’d program can be SIGKILL’d without receiving a SIGCONT first</li>
<li>systemd’s watchdog mechanism can and probably will restart a service that is SIGSTOP’d as a result</li>
</ul>
<p>However, “freezing” all logged-in user accounts should still be feasible in theory. This would prevent any running malware from doing anything while the user is in the emergency session, thus it would be unable to force the user to a different TTY. Any malware on the system that wasn’t running as a logged-in user would have to be running as root or be able to elevate its privileges to that of a logged-in user in order to gain access to a console and thus change TTYs.</p>
<p>One thing that is still uncertain about SIGSTOP is how it behaves when dealing with stuck kernel threads. If a thread calls into the kernel and then gets stuck there (such as can happen when dealing with flaky I/O devices), it cannot be SIGKILL’d or SIGSTOP’d. What’s unclear is whether the process’s <em>other</em> threads can be SIGKILL’d or SIGSTOP’d in this situation. If the answer is “yes”, then using SIGSTOP should be an effective freezing mechanism, but if the answer is “no”, then malware may be able to circumvent a SIGSTOP by launching a thread that then does something to get stuck in the kernel. Getting a thread stuck in kernel mode is hard though (I believe it should be impossible without either buggy hardware, a buggy kernel, or root access, <s>and even with root access you’d have to do something convoluted like set up a VM with an NFS share, mount the NFS share on the host, kill the VM abruptly, and then attempt I/O on the mounted share</s> edit: just tried something like this, even this doesn’t result in a stuck kernel thread, <a href="https://chrisdown.name/2024/02/05/reliably-creating-d-state-processes-on-demand.html" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Creating controllable D state (uninterruptible sleep) processes</a> has better instructions for getting a process stuck in a kernel thread), so this might not be an issue.</p>
<p>Another difficulty is that we most likely are not going to go through a display manager., As a result, the “session” we will end up in will be rather limited and things that one might expect to work (like systemd user units, DBus, some xdg-related things, etc.) probably won’t work. Thus the functionality within the emergency session will need to be limited to cope with this. (This will also prevent us from simply switching to a sysmaint session when the salute is registered - the sysmaint session has features that depend on a full login session running. It most likely will not behave itself well if it doesn’t have all of the infrastructure usually set up by a display manager working right. We also can’t just switch to the sysmaint session because some of the features of the sysmaint session, like software updates, are not things that can be safely done when booted into a user session. Even if they work now, they won’t work once we implement Verified Boot.)</p>
<p>Obviously, some form of authorization will be needed in order to access the features of this emergency session. Otherwise any attacker with physical access to the system could use this to take the system over entirely. It shouldn’t be too difficult to implement an authorization prompt of some sort to make this work. Because of the need for authorization, the graphical session MUST NOT run as root, since then any arbitrary code execution vulnerability in a used graphical toolkit or Wayland compositor could allow an attacker with physical access to gain unauthorized root access. The sysmaint account would be ideal to use instead, since then if the user has set a password, they will have to provide it in order to run any privileged operations.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>My idea was to use the existing emerg-shutdown framework (which monitors for a “panic” key combo already) to also act as the Ctrl+Alt+Delete handler. That would make it work anywhere in the system, and could also (if handled carefully) prevent malware running as a local user from being able to interfere with the key handler and associated features.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Set a local shortcuts config for user and sysmaint? Downside would be these keyboard shortcuts would not populate if user uses sysmaint to create more users.

<p>That might be like Intel ME on steroids.</p>
<p>I may also not be the best idea to come up with more and more complex hardware designs. They’ll forget (or “forget”?) to disable some debugging feature. (<a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/IOS" class="inline-onebox">Apple iOS - Malicious Backdoor or Debugging Feature? The Debate Over Operation Triangulation</a>) → <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/About_Computer_(In)Security#Too_Much_Complexity">Too much complexity, etc.</a></p>
<p>As for end-user, desktop computers and notebooks, there does not seem to be any hardware vendors on Intel/AMD64 interested to provide such functionality. This might be due to lack of customer interest. The x86 market is shrinking.</p>
<p>On Intel/AMD64 we can be glad if we get at least <a href="https://github.com/openSIL/openSIL">OpenSIL</a>. That might be the next realistic step after <a href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/t/verified-boot/901/5">Sovereign Boot</a>.</p>
<p>And if we’re really fortunate, maybe one day we’ll have <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Open-source_Hardware" class="inline-onebox">Open Source Hardware</a>. I’d prefer that any day about any proprietary co-processor.</p>
<p>The security co-processor design is to be considered in 10 to 20 years. That’s far away from anything realistic we’ll be working on anytime soon.</p>
