</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I don’t think this is supported configuration in any way. While theoretically mismatching keyboard layouts between dom0 and VM may work in some (many) cases, it does lead to various corner cases (for example if one of those layouts assign different meaning for some modifiers, they won’t synchronize properly anymore). Keyboard layout should be modified at dom0 level.</p>
<p>If one wants to use different layouts in different VMs, there are dom0 applications that can switch layouts based on active window - I believe KDE has this built in, but also I get similar behavior with Xfce built-in layout switcher, if I switch layout with some window active, by clicking on the widget, not key combo.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I can additionally confirm that even when setting keyboard layout settings in dom0, layout switching is broken when using KDE in dom0. Pressing the keyboard layout switch shortcut (Meta+Alt+K by default) results in a popup appearing in dom0 that <em>says</em> the keyboard layout has been changed, but the keyboard layout does not actually change within a debian-13-minimal AppVM. If I run <code>sh -x /usr/lib/qubes/qubes-keymap.sh</code> in a terminal window, I don’t see anything printed to the terminal when pressing Meta+Alt+K in the KDE session, so it looks like the keyboard layout change notification isn’t reaching the AppVM at all. In contrast, if I log into the Xfce session in dom0, configure a second keyboard layout, run <code>sh -x /usr/lib/qubes/qubes-keymap.sh</code> in a <code>debian-13-minimal</code> AppVM, and then press the keyboard layout change shortcut, I see some text scroll down in the AppVM terminal upon pressing the shortcut. The keyboard layout within the VM also changes, so things seem to be working properly there.</p> ]]></description>

<p>Yes, almost without question (I’m testing it now). Edit: Just tested, this is reproducible in <code>debian-13-minimal</code> after installing <code>lxqt-config</code> and using it to add a second keyboard layout.</p>

</aside>
<p>Because the original poster is trying to do something fundamentally different than what <code>qubes-keymap.sh</code> does. <code>qubes-keymap.sh</code> takes the keyboard layout settings from dom0 and loads those settings into each individual qube. What the poster is trying to do is configure keyboard layouts <em>at the AppVM level</em>, separate from dom0. Why is somewhat unclear (maybe they want to use different keyboard layout settings in different VMs, or maybe they’re trying to work around a limitation of the KDE session, or both), but that’s what they’re doing, as I understand it. This is why they mention settings things up in LXQt’s configuration, even though dom0 doesn’t have LXQt components installed most likely.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Virtualbox installers stopped working</title>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>1 forum thread = 1 issue only please. In this case, 1 forum thread = 1 method only please. So I’ll only focus on the installer method.</p>
<p>For other methods such as manually adding the VirtualBox repository, using extrepo (which does the same), if still relevant, please open a separate forum thread.</p>

</aside>
<p>I was able to reproduce this. It can happen when you only used sysmaint session so far. In other words, this can happen if you never started a user session yet. In result, account <code>user</code> has never logged in. However, the home directly of account <code>user</code> is only created upon its first login.</p>
<p>So the solution is: Boot into user session at least once. Then you can reboot into a sysmaint session and the installer should be functional.</p>
<p>A more helpful error message pointing that out will be added in a future release.</p>

<p>This is “largely” not a different method. virtualbox-installer-cli and kicksecure-lxqt-installer-cli share the very same source code. So if virtualbox-installer-cli, there is no need to try any of the other Linux installers by Kicksecure (or Whonix).</p>

        <title>Separate (some) user applications from the operating system</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Discussed some aspects of this with Patrick more, I’m not sure if we’re getting closer to a concrete implementation plan or not, but here’s some rough notes about what we were thinking:</p>
<p>Right now we have two privilege levels, <code>user</code> and <code>sysmaint</code>. <code>sysmaint</code> has the power most administrative users on other distros have; it’s “root with light safeguards to make it harder to do something foolish on accident”. <code>user</code> is more like what non-administrative users on Windows are; they can run arbitrary applications, work with files, use the network, etc., but they can’t mess with the guts of the system. This provides some additional security since it’s harder to get a foothold in the root account, but ultimately it doesn’t do much to fight malware that wants to steal or encrypt the user’s data, except for making it more likely that a user will be mindful about what they install.</p>
<p>Our ultimate goal, however we implement it, is to add a third privilege level to this model. Let’s call it <code>untrusted-user</code> (bad name, but it gets the point across for now).</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard <code>user</code> privilege level will retain all of the power it currently has. It is also where all of the user’s trusted data will be stored.</li>
<li>The <code>untrusted-user</code> privilege level is where more dangerous applications (such as web browsers) should run. This privilege level should be resistant to <em>attacker-incited</em> persistent compromise, while simultaneously expecting temporary compromise. That is, if an attacker manages to compromise a legitimate application running as <code>untrusted-user</code>, that compromise must be able to “just go away” somehow. While the attacker has a foothold in <code>untrusted-user</code>, our implementation must contain that compromise if at all possible so that it cannot gain access to <code>user</code> data.
<ul>
<li>This implies that <code>untrusted-user</code> will be at least semi-ephemeral; changes made by malware need to be able to be erased reliably in some fashion.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It is likely that the <code>untrusted-user</code> environment will suffer from <em>user-incited</em> persistent compromise (i.e. someone intentionally installed malware into the environment). It therefore must be possible to get rid of malware of this kind in some manner.</li>
<li>Users may work with data they want to store long-term when using <code>untrusted-user</code>, so they must be able to save that data persistently. Some of that data may be trusted, in which case there needs to be a way to move it into the <code>user</code> privilege level (users will obviously have to be very careful about what data they move), while some of that data may be untrusted and needs to stay in the <code>untrusted-user</code> privilege level. Users will also need to be able to move files from the <code>user</code> privilege level to the <code>untrusted-user</code> level.</li>
<li>Users will be running resource-intensive apps (most notably web browsers) in the <code>untrusted-user</code> privilege level. They will also be running these apps within potentially resource-constrained virtual machines. Thus, performance concerns have to be taken into account. Any solution based on virtualization will have to take into account the fact that nested virtualization may be disabled or may not be available at all (such as on current versions of Qubes OS).</li>
<li>Users will be running apps that make use of Linux’s native sandboxing capabilities. The implementation of <code>untrusted-user</code> <strong>must not break or weaken these sandboxes if at all possible.</strong></li>
<li>Applications running as <code>untrusted-user</code> are going to have to do IPC with things that run as <code>user</code> (most notably Wayland, Pipewire, and terminal emulator software, but probably also others). This provides substantial attack surface; Wayland is not a simple protocol, and labwc is not written in a memory-safe language, so I would not be surprised if a motivated attacker could attack the compositor to escape the sandbox.</li>
<li>We do not know what applications the user will run in the sandbox. The sandbox should work transparently with as many existing applications as possible.</li>
<li>Users will have legitimate reasons to run things in the <code>user</code> privilege level for compatibility or performance reasons. Not everything can be pushed into a container or VM and just work. However, a subset of users will only want to use the <code>user</code> privilege level for managing application that run as <code>untrusted-user</code>, or for very basic tasks. For those users who can afford to lock down <code>user</code>, there should be an option that uses a project like <a href="https://github.com/roddhjav/apparmor.d">apparmor.d</a> to lock down the <code>user</code> privilege level. This might be worth while to enable by default and make opt-out.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two main sandboxing models that I can see, per-application sandboxing and per-usecase sandboxing. Firejail, Bubblewrap, Flatpak, and sandbox-app-launcher are examples of the former kind. I personally do not believe this is the best way of doing things, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Per-application sandboxing generally involves figuring out everything a particular application needs, allowlisting it, and then denying everything else. This means that a special profile has to be written for every application, and that lots of fiddling is needed to ensure good application compatibility. sandbox-app-launcher doesn’t seem to have had this problem, but Firejail and Bubblejail certainly do.</li>
<li>Per-application sandboxing makes it confusing, difficult, or impossible to run the same app in two different “trust domains”. It causes similar implications when trying to run multiple apps in the same “trust domain”.</li>
<li>Because each application is isolated independently of others, one cannot easily sandbox utilities that are primarily used as parts of larger systems. For instance, it’s hard to imagine a useful generic sandbox for <code>netcat</code>. Per-usecase sandboxing allows one to sandbox these lower-level utilities meaningfully (for instance, maybe my “software-dev” environment should only allow <code>netcat</code> to reach out to <code>termbin.com</code>, while my “document-processing” environment should allow it to reach out to a local network printer for… some reason… this is a bad example but you get my point).</li>
<li>Because each application is isolated independently of others, IPC becomes a concern. Should a sandboxed Tor Browser be able to ask my file manager to open a directory and show me the contents? On the surface, the answer is “yes”, because I might want to use its “Open containing folder” feature after downloading something. But what if the browser is compromised, and it’s able to use the ability to open my file manager by itself as part of a social engineering attack, trying to convince me to upload sensitive data somewhere? It shouldn’t be able to do that. With per-usecase sandboxing, I can say that Tor Browser should be allowed to communicate with <em>anything</em> within its sandbox, for any reason, but <em>nothing</em> outside of its sandbox. If the browser then decides to open a file manager window out of nowhere, it will be recognizably not my normal file manager, and it won’t be able to show me any sensitive files, so the attack’s likelihood of success goes down.</li>
<li>Sandboxing of server-like “applications” becomes harder, especially if they depend on and integrate with things like systemd.</li>
</ul>
<p>Per-usecase sandboxing is basically what containers and VMs give us. VMs are better from a security standpoint in a lot of ways, but due to resource constraints and compatibility issues, we can’t rely on them alone like I was suggesting previously. Containers are somewhat scary because they run directly on the host kernel, meaning that any host kernel bug in code accessible to the container can be exploited, potentially allowing an attacker to obtain kernel-level privileges. That being said, they’re better than nothing, and they allow working around many of the limitations of virtual machines (for instance, 3d acceleration can work inside containers).</p>
<p>There are a lot of existing containerization systems out there; Docker, LXC, LXD, Incus, systemd-nspawn, libvirt-lxc, etc. Which one of these would be good to build on top of, I’m not quite sure yet, but I initially think either systemd-nspawn or libvirt-lxc would be a good option. One nice thing about libvirt-lxc is that it allows defining a container in much the same way one would define a virtual machine, and libvirt provides both container and virtual machine functionality. This might permit implementing both VM-based sandboxing and container-based sandboxing in the same application. Something similar could be done with systemd-nspawn and systemd-vmspawn possibly, but unfortunately systemd-vmspawn is not present in Debian Trixie, so this may not be the best option.</p>
<p>In my mind, an ideal sandboxing solution would look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>There’s a privileged daemon (let’s call it <code>sandboxd</code>), which listens for requests to create and manage sandboxes. <code>sandboxd</code> creates sandboxes by using <code>mmdebstrap</code> to create a Debian rootfs with proper UIDs and GIDs so that an unprivileged sandbox can be booted. This daemon runs as root so that it can make the needed ownership changes after bootstrapping a new sandbox.</li>
<li>There’s a user-accessible application (call it <code>sandboxctl</code>) that talks to the daemon in order to do things like create, delete, rename, query information about, start, and stop sandboxes. It can also request files to be moved between the user’s home folder and the sandbox’s home folder, or can request a directory to be transparently passed through.</li>
<li>A number of validating proxies for basic, unavoidable IPC are provided with the system. These proxies do things like virtualize Wayland, Pipewire, and console access, preventing malicious interactions with parts of the system that run under the <code>user</code> privilege level.</li>
<li>A number of basic permissions exist (“allow network”, “allow GUI”, “allow audio”, “allow mic”, “allow 3d accel”, etc.). These permissions can be toggled on or off at the trust domain level. Wherever possible, validating proxies are used to enable these permissions rather than just passing through bits of the host system to the container. In some situation though, host passthrough will likely be unavoidable, for instance for passing through something like <code>/dev/dri/renderD128</code> for 3d acceleration.</li>
<li>A helper application using seccomp-bpf will be provided that will deny the ability to create user namespaces to most applications in some way (handwaving here, haven’t thought this through fully). Only specific applications that need user namespaces such as web browsers will be run without this application wrapping them, thus allowing us to have the lessened kernel attack surface of “no user namespaces”, and the better in-browser security that comes with user namespaces.</li>
<li>Sandboxes can be booted with an optional RAM-based overlay within the sandbox to make them ephemeral. Only specific folders within the sandbox’s home folder such as Documents would be exempted (bind mounting would be needed for this). This would allow a user to make a sandbox “forget” a compromise, even one that used files like <code>~/.bashrc</code> for persistence, by simply rebooting the sandbox. For software updates and installation, the sandbox could be booted in a fully persistent mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the basic architecture in my mind. This would meet all of the criteria above AFAICT.</p>
<p>The hardest part of this is probably going to be the validating proxies. What might be doable instead is to run a real Wayland compositor and audio server within the sandbox, then use simpler protocols like VNC and audio streaming to get video and audio out of the container. A terminal emulator could then be run within the sandbox rather than using a <code>user</code>-privileged terminal emulator to interface with the sandbox. The performance impact of this might be substantial, and it could make things like the clipboard harder to use, but perhaps not impossible. Research would have to be done into this.</p>
<p>Everything after this is research I did into a bunch of existing sandboxing mechanisms and why I think they probably aren’t suitable for what we want to do.</p>
<ul>
<li>VirtualBox and KVM are both very resource intensive. They require lots of disk space, lots of memory, lots of CPU power, and destroy the ability to use graphics hardware acceleration (which is necessary to do things like watch videos at reasonable resolutions). They require hardware virtualization features, making them unsuitable for use within Qubes or environments where nested virtualization isn’t available or is painfully slow.</li>
<li>Flatpak uses a combination of namespaces, cgroups, and seccomp to sandbox applications. While good in theory, in practice this results in a lot of problems:
<ul>
<li>Many Flatpaks have very loose permissions, and those that don’t oftentimes don’t work right.</li>
<li>seccomp is used to deny access to features that may increase kernel attack surface, like user namespaces. This breaks Chrome’s sandbox among other things, making it more dangerous to use a Flatpak-packaged browser than an apt-packaged one.</li>
<li>Sandboxed applications connect directly to the Wayland compositor, which is unsafe as described above.</li>
<li>The way in which Flatpaks bundle dependencies means that oftentimes Flatpaks can contain insecure dependencies, resulting in security problems. <a href="https://flatkill.org/">https://flatkill.org/</a> goes into a lot of detail on that.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Snap suffers from similar issues as Flatpak, though it may not be as bad from a dependency standpoint if it uses packages from the Ubuntu archive. It may also handle nested sandboxing better. It’s a semi-closed-source system dependent upon Canonical though, so it may be better avoided.</li>
<li>Bubblewrap can be used on its own, without Flatpak. Depending on what exactly is being done, this <em>can</em> be a viable sandboxing mechanism, it might be usable instead of systemd-nspawn or libvirt-lxc. I’m not sure if it has advantages beyond these mechanisms yet, it might complicate attempts to make VM-based sandboxing work.</li>
<li>I took a look at Landlock. It looks like a rather interesting way to do some of the things AppArmor does, but without needing privileges. It can be used to do things like make an application that says “I need to be able to read from this dir, read and write this other dir, and read, write, and execute this third dir, and that’s it.” Then the kernel will keep it from doing anything other than the things it locked itself into doing.
<ul>
<li>This isn’t really what we’re looking for I would argue. It might be interesting for some specific usecases, but… we already have AppArmor for this sort of thing. This is a variant on mandatory access control, which doesn’t provide the compatibility we’re looking for.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>AppArmor is something we’re already familiar with, as we actively use it to do things like sandbox Tor Browser.
<ul>
<li>This requires a custom policy to be written for each sandboxed application, which is a pain, and it also doesn’t do much to work with applications that don’t work if you deny them resources that are potentially dangerous. It also doesn’t allow isolating data into separate <code>untrusted-user</code> environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Firejail is designed to sandbox individual applications using individually written profiles. It also allows the user to create custom profiles for applications that don’t have profiles written for them already. It sandboxes the applications that already exist on the root filesystem.
<ul>
<li>It’s SUID-root, which is problematic since we’re trying to get rid of such applications.</li>
<li>While simple to use in theory, it seems to require the user to know that they’re doing a bit more than I personally would prefer. Rather than saying “this set of apps has its own environment”, it says “here are the parts of the <code>user</code> environment this particular app can access.” This is possibly dangerous since it blurs the lines between the privilege levels we want to establish. For instance, a browser should naturally be allowed to save things in Downloads, but what if you have sensitive company data in your Downloads folder, and your browser gets compromised and uploads it?</li>
<li>There has been at least one TOCTOU vuln in Firejail which allowed an attacker to escalate their privileges to root. This is arguably proof that Firejail as an SUID application is a less-than-great idea. <a href="https://unparalleled.eu/blog/2021/20210208-rigged-race-against-firejail-for-local-root/" class="inline-onebox">Rigged Race Against Firejail for Local Root</a> is a good example. There have been other vulnerabilities in Firejail that make this look dangerous.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a bit long, but hopefully it will be useful.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Add second language to layout</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@arraybolt3]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>In case it’s useful, I was able to successfully reproduce this on an entirely clean installation of Qubes R4.3.0 with the Xfce desktop:</p>
<p>Using keyboard layout settings in dom0 Xfce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set English and German as keyboard layout languages in dom0</li>
<li>Set switching key to Alt+Shift in dom0</li>
<li>Set Compose key to right Ctrl in dom0</li>
<li>Started AppVM <code>personal</code> (based on <code>fedora-42-xfce</code>)
<ul>
<li>I can switch between English and German in this AppVM using Alt+Shift</li>
<li>Both languages seem to work right initially</li>
<li>Compose key works</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Started AppVM <code>anon-whonix</code> (based on <code>whonix-workstation-18</code>)
<ul>
<li>I can switch between English and German in this AppVM using Alt+Shift</li>
<li>Both languages seem to work right initially</li>
<li>Compose key works</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Using keyboard layout settings in individual AppVMs, dom0 still using Xfce:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reverted all keyboard layout changes in dom0, logged out of dom0 and then logged back in</li>
<li>Started AppVM <code>personal</code> (based on <code>fedora-42-xfce</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite</p>
<ul>
<li>Confirmed that the keyboard layout is now stuck on US, as expected</li>
<li>In the AppVM itself, set English and German as keyboard layout languages, set switching key to Alt+Shift, set Compose key to right Ctrl</li>
<li>I can switch between English and German in this AppVM using Alt+Shift</li>
<li>Both languages seem to work right initially</li>
<li>Compose key works</li>
<li>Started AppVM <code>anon-whonix</code> (based on <code>whonix-workstation-18</code>)
<ul>
<li>Confirmed that the keyboard layout is stuck on US, as expected</li>
<li>Confirmed that I could have the keyboard layout language in <code>personal</code> set to German and the keyboard layout language in <code>anon-whonix</code> set to English at the same time, both languages seem to work</li>
<li>In the AppVM itself, set English and German as keyboard layout languages, set switching key to Alt+Shift (LXQt settings didn’t allow configuring the compose key)</li>
<li>I can switch between English and German in this AppVM using Alt+Shift</li>
<li>Both languages seem to work right initially</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Shut down both <code>anon-whonix</code> and <code>personal</code></li>
<li>Started both <code>anon-whonix</code> and <code>personal</code></li>
<li>Tested keyboard layouts in <code>personal</code>
<ul>
<li>Can still switch keyboard layout languages between English and German in this AppVM</li>
<li>Both languages seem to work right initially</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tested keyboard layouts in <code>anon-whonix</code>
<ul>
<li>Cannot switch keyboard layout languages between English and German in this AppVM</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>(I was going to test KDE next, but this was able to be reproduced before getting to that.)</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/marmarek">@marmarek</a> I don’t think this is a Qubes problem (at least not all of it; the KDE weirdness might be, but the failure to preserve VM-specific keyboard layouts I think is a Kicksecure thing). Adjusting the keyboard layout settings in LXQt adjusts the configuration in <code>~/.config/lxqt/session.conf</code>, which <a href="https://github.com/lxqt/wiki/blob/2adb0331555757c8d8ffa48b79d8121b0ffffa22/docs/lxqt.wiki/General.md">is supposed to be read by lxqt-session</a>. lxqt-session isn’t even installed in a Qubes environment, so the component of LXQt that would restore the keyboard layout settings in this way is missing entirely.</p>
<p>lxqt-session was intentionally left out because it doesn’t manage the session in a Qubes environment, <a href="https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-gui-agent-linux/blob/main/appvm-scripts/usrbin/qubes-session">qubes-session</a> does. Unsurprisingly and reasonably, qubes-session does not know how to interpret LXQt’s session.conf (or anyone else’s session config for that matter; why this works with Xfce is unclear, though I suspect xfconfd is what’s making things work). Thus something else has to do that job.</p>
<p>The best solution would probably be to figure out how to get lxqt-session to do only those things that are “reasonable” under Qubes OS, like loading keyboard layouts, and ignore everything else. I haven’t had much luck with this; I can start lxqt-session inside an anon-whonix AppVM, but it doesn’t seem to do anything to the keyboard layouts when launched, and its configuration options aren’t really working the way I would expect, so I don’t know how practical this is. (It’s not looking very hopeful initially :P)</p>
<p>As a fallback, we could write some code that could read the LXQt keyboard layout configuration and load it into X11 at startup. This is non-ideal and would be Qubes-specific since Kicksecure uses Wayland on non-Qubes platforms now, but it would work.</p> ]]></description>

<p>[1] It could be very hard for laymen users to confirm functionality. There is one thing you might be able to see. → <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Ram-wipe#Shutdown_Printout">Shutdown Printout</a></p>
<p>But these messages will probably appear so fast and the reboot/shutdown is so fast that can most people probably will have reasonable chance to read messages. One simple “trick” could be to video record the shutdown process with camera and then watch/pause the recording.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Advanced_Users" class="inline-onebox">Advanced Users</a>, at least a basic review using a serial console is possible. There are some pointers here: <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Dev/RAM_Wipe#ram-wipe_Functionality_Testing">ram-wipe Functionality Testing</a></p>
<p>Otherwise if messages are appearing to fast, developers locally for example inject <code>sleep</code> commands into the code or inject a shell.</p>
<p>Full review can be done by developers / expert. The test methodology had been fully documented during the 3MDEB security-misc audit.</p>

        <title>Start up is a little strange for me in version 18</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@trizzo]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi. I recently updated Kicksecure to version 18. The start up sequence is strange. I’m not a coder or anything, and have very little knowledge but I’ll explain briefly what’s happening to me.</p>
<p>When I turn on my laptop, it goes to the boot options (persistent, live mode, etc.). If I select either live mode or persistent, things start up normally, however when it comes to the part where I need to type in my password, for some reason the console freaks out and creates a loop of text (again, I’m sorry for being vague, as with such little knowledge I don’t know how to explain these things). Now in the midst of this strange loop of text, if I type my password in, it works and logs me in. Just a little strange, I can still access my computer and all, it’s just really weird.</p>

<p>Proper bug report as per <a href="https://www.kicksecure.com/wiki/Reporting_Bugs#Sample_Bug_Report">Sample Bug Report</a> required.</p>
<p>But as for ram-wipe. let me wild guess… You’re used to seeing lots of output (by <code>sdmem</code>) during shut down but cannot see that anymore?</p>
<p>No. That’s invalid methodology. ram-wipe nowadays works differently and more efficiently. There is no more need to use sdmem.</p>

        <title>Ram-wipe no longer functional in Kicksecure 18?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@trizzo]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hi. I just upgraded to Kicksecure 18. It looks amazing! Well done guys!</p>
<p>However I have many issues that I’ll list below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ram-Wipe no longer works</li>
<li>Start up sequence is weird, loops around and around until I type my passphrase in, then it works</li>
<li>I cannot create multiple desktops! Something I need personally</li>
<li>The panel doesn’t intelligently hide when I select the option for it to hide when a window overlaps.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than these few things I’ve noticed, it is all in all pretty good!</p>
<p>Cheers guys, I hope these problems can be fixed soon <img src="https://forums.kicksecure.com/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=14" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:" loading="lazy" width="20" height="20"></p> ]]></description>

<p>I don’t really understand why disabling the service in the template isn’t working. Will test here and document what needs to be done to turn it off if the steps end up being harder than a simple <code>sudo systemctl disable usbguard.service</code> command.</p>

<p>Found the issue, <code>usbguard-dbus.service</code> also needs disabled with <code>sudo systemctl disable usbguard-dbus.service</code>. Once both this and <code>usbguard.service</code> are disabled, USB devices are transparently accepted in a Kicksecure-based sys-usb.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>318 MB is a lot; our ISO is around 1244 MB at the moment, and while squashfs compression would reduce the size of LibreOffice a lot, it’s still quite a bit of additional bytes (which can make a big difference when it comes to download costs, though I don’t know how much the server hosting costs).

<blockquote>
<p>Is this the intended behavior? If not, could we consider adding a brief display message before the shutdown occurs?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>This is the intended behavior indeed.</p>
<p>Adding a display message (or any pause of any kind) would be a security hazard for the threat model emerg-shutdown is meant to defend against. Imagine you’re using Kicksecure from an external USB drive, and you’re using it to do something a physically proximate adversary doesn’t like. As you’re doing this work, the adversary suddenly breaks open the door to the room you’re in and starts walking toward you quickly. At this point one of your primary concerns is turning off the computer as quickly as possible so that all traces of what you were doing are erased. Every millisecond counts in this scenario, so emerg-shutdown is designed to power off the computer with all haste. It doesn’t make any attempt to save unsaved data, sync filesystems, warn the user of what’s going to happen, etc. it just* tells the kernel to cut power to the system as quickly as it can.</p>
<p>*well, almost; to work around kernel bugs that can result in a kernel panic during shutdown, emerg-shutdown switches to an unused TTY first. This is necessary to keep the system from hanging or rebooting instead of shutting down if you’re using Intel graphics, at least on some systems.</p>
<p>More about emerg-shutdown’s threat model, implementation, and usage is here:</p>

<p>Tested it in a VM just now. It looks like this is not possible; if I drag-n-drop the “user” desktop shortcut into a file sharing website, it ends up uploading a single small file named <code>user-home.desktop</code>, not my entire home folder. Screenshot:</p>

<p>Hey folks,</p>
<p>I recently gave Brave a spin and the browser‑choice panel worked flawlessly, very cool thanks!</p>
<p>However, when I tried to install Chromium through the same panel, it stalled for several minutes with no progress shown in the terminal. I restarted the process a few times, but the result was the same: a blank, black screen.</p>
<p>The only method that finally succeeded was a manual installation <code>sudo apt install --no-recommends chromium chromium-sandbox</code></p>
<p>The installation is quite long for chromium as opposed for Brave. Could this be a Wayland related issue? When I install Chromium manually, I see status updates, but the browser‑choice UI gives me nothing but darkness in the term emulator.</p> ]]></description>

<p>So I noticed LibreOffice is not packaged with Kicksecure?</p>
<p>Please bundle a minimal LibreOffice installation with the most common language packs for North‑American and European users, plus dictionary and thesaurus plug‑ins.</p>

    libreoffice-writer \
    libreoffice-l10-en-us \
    hungspell-us-en-us \
    mythes-en-us
</code></pre>
<p>This is how I installed LibreOffice with document editor alone minimally with dictionary/thesaurus plugin dependency for English only.</p>
<p>(<strong>Anyone following along can use the installation command (minimal writer‑only setup, English only above</strong>)</p>
<p>For the distro to include all packs with a wildcard like libreoffice-l10-* would increase size too much so which I would assume is why it wasn’t included to keep ISO size small. With english packs alone for my minimal install it was <s>150</s> 318MB. Where as if you choose more then english it would be 400MB-600MB roughly I would suppose.</p> ]]></description>

<p>I noticed that neither sysmaint nor user displayed a battery indicator. As a laptop user, that icon is essential when I’m installing software or applying updates.</p>
<p>Below are the terminal checks I ran:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">[user ~]% systemctl --user status upower
Unit upower.service could not be found.
zsh: exit 4     systemctl --user status upower
[user ~]% qdbus org.lxqt.panel /org/lxqt/Panel1 
zsh: command not found: qdbus
zsh: exit 127   qdbus org.lxqt.panel /org/lxqt/Panel1
[user ~]% dbus-send --session --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower --print-reply /org/freedesktop/UPower org.freedesktop.DBus.Introspectable.Introspect

Error org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.ServiceUnknown: The name org.freedesktop.UPower was not provided by any .service files
zsh: exit 1     dbus-send --session --dest=org.freedesktop.UPower --print-reply  
[user ~]% 
</code></pre>
<p>First, I inspected the upower service in sysmaint. It reported “active but disabled,” so I enabled it <code>sudo systemctl enable upower</code> and rebooted into the user session.</p>
<p>Even after that, the power indicator remained elusive, and the panel lacked a battery widget entirely.</p>
<p>The workaround? I opened Power Management, ticked Enable Battery Watcher, and finally got something to appear at the top of the panel. It isn’t the classic battery icon, but it does show the charging state e.g., “Charging (100 %), to full 0 minute(s).” Unfortunately, the physical LED on my laptop is NOT green despite it saying 100 % with 0 minutes remaining lol</p>
<p>Any reason why the widget is not installed? Security reasons? Wayland issues?</p> ]]></description>
