* Big time advantage: not bothering to sandbox single services one by one, we sandbox everything as much as we can by default and exempt services where applicable. We can do this only for very obvious privileges that are only required by a very limited number of known services. It will still bring a lot of value in hardening.

* Step 1: Create a global hardened drop in for all services

Under ```/etc/systemd/system/service.d``` create ```25_security-misc.conf```, with the content:
```
[Service]
ProtectProc=invisible
ProcSubset=pid
NoNewPrivileges=true
SecureBits=noroot-locked
ProtectClock=true
ProtectHostname=true
RestrictNamespaces=true
LockPersonality=true
PrivateTmp=yes
ProtectHome=yes
ProtectKernelLogs=yes
ProtectKernelModules=yes
ProtectKernelTunables=yes
RestrictSUIDSGID=true
MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true
RemoveIPC=true
UMask=0077
# InaccessiblePaths=/sys
NoExecPaths=/
ExecPaths=/usr/sbin/ /usr/lib /usr/lib64 /usr/bin
PrivateDevices=true
```
* Step 2: Whitelist vital system components so that we don't actually die

* For common and used time synchronization daemons, such as systemd-timesyncd, create the following drop-in:
```
[Service]
ProtectClock=false
```
* For the systemd-login daemon, the following drop-in:
```
[Service]
ProcSubset=all
ProtectProc=false
```

* For systemd-modules-load and quite possibly other services, we need enable sticking modules to the kernel and stuff:
```
[Service]
ProtectKernelModules=yes
ProtectKernelTunables=yes
```

* For systemd-journald and auditd and if applicable other known logging daemons, the following drop in:
```
[Service]
ProtectKernelLogs=no
```

* This is an extensive list. ```RestrictNamespaces=true``` probably needs exemption for apt and possibly some other privileged things. 
* ```LockPersonality=true``` might break random virtual box things, so that might be left out if necessary.
* ```MemoryDenyWriteExecute=true``` might need exemption for desktop environments especially when using xorg, and probably some other things, for now not clear without testing.
* ```RemoveIPC=true``` will most certainly break xorg, so DE components that rely on xorg will need drop-ins.
* ```ProtectHostname``` needs an exception for services that need that for sure, what those are yet to be cleared.
* PrivateDevices need exemption for services that do mounting and unmounting, only a few of them are there. Mount units need no exception, only services do.
* Other things should not break anything given the exception drop-ins. Not tested this except for ProtectProc, which works as I intended. One exception drop-in does the job. So they might break more, and more exception drop-ins might be required. Will create a pull when I find the time to write a test version and actually test it.</span></p>

systemd

### Is your feature request related to a problem? Please<span class="show-more-container"><a href="" rel="noopener" class="show-more">…</a></span><span class="excerpt hidden"> describe

Currently, systemd supports the use of drop-in files to extend or override configuration settings for unit files. While systemd provides the `ConditionPathExists` directive to conditionally start a service based on the existence of a file or directory, there is no built-in mechanism to conditionally apply drop-in files based on custom conditions within those files.

It would be highly beneficial to have a feature in systemd that allows for the conditional application of drop-in files based on custom conditions. This would provide users with greater flexibility and control over the configuration of systemd units.

A specific example would be the following one:

* https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc/issues/213

Complex hardening would be enabled by default. But to easily opt-in/out the additional hardening, to simplify testing, a status file would be helpful.

### Describe the solution you'd like

Introduce a new directive, such as `ConditionDropIn`, that allows users to specify custom conditions within drop-in files themselves. This directive could accept a condition expression similar to other systemd directives, enabling users to define conditions based on various factors such as the existence of specific files, system properties, environment variables, or other runtime conditions.

Example:

`/lib/systemd/system/myservice.service.d/50_drop-in.conf`

```
[Service]
ConditionDropIn=Exists:/path/to/status/file

# Additional configuration specific to the condition, which is disregarded if the status file does not exist.
```

In this example, the drop-in file `50_user.conf` would only be applied if the file `/path/to/status/file` exists.


### Describe alternatives you've considered

Packaging, scripting.

### The systemd version you checked that didn't have the feature you are asking for

<p>So, how come that there isn’t Ungoogled Chromium</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Brave Browser is a better choice then Google Chrome since it has its own onion debian repository that it can be installed and updated from it just requires the correct tor apt configuration in the sources list. But again thats a <em>choice</em> lol I would say as long as chromium is being installed via the debian repo and not a manual <code>.deb</code> download page I read people recommend to install it I would it’s fine. If only ungoogled-chromium was in the debian repo I would suggest it over Brave possibly.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So much intriguing lore in this discussion.</p>
<p>Here is my 2cents, I think bluetooth USB class should either be rejected altogether or a commented out line that rejects them should be there for common ground like other of the lines in configs related to bluetooth. Since kicksecure doesn’t disable bluetooth altogether it does have lines that do if you need to.</p> ]]></description>

        <title>Disabling eBPF functionality completely for container software?</title>
        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@goose4]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>So I was wondering if Kicksecure should disable eBPF altogether for containers?</p>
<p>Security-Misc already addresses 2 related BPF settings for the kernel hardening</p>
<ol>
<li>[Restrict usage of bpf() to CAP_BPF to prevent the loading of BPF programs by unprivileged users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>net.core.bpf_jit_harden=2</code></p>
</blockquote>
<ol start="2">
<li>[Enable hardening of the BPF JIT compiler for all users.]</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><code>kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I was wondering if some kind of drop in for container software like Podman and Docker could be made to disable eBPF altogether or certain aspects?</p>
<p>Was looking at <code>/etc/containers/containers.conf.d/</code> for a drop in but I see no options that address them or are universally applied for all container software?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>/etc/containers</code> is a standard configuration directory used by several container‑related tools on Linux systems, most notably Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, and the CRI‑O runtime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then when it comes to Docker the only idea I came up with is <code>/etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/disable-bpf.conf</code> with <code>ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd --no-bpf</code></p>
<p>What got me thinking about this was this proof on concept here:</p>
<p>github. com/hackerschoice/bpfhacks</p>
<p>Besides the two kernel related hardening is there really any other ways to mitigate this type of attack or is it a moot point since it requires attacker to gain root.</p>
<p>These are just some thoughts that came to mind sorry if this post looks like security cosplay at first glance.</p> ]]></description>

<blockquote>
<p>No claims are made with regard to anti forensics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Live mode attempts to mount all persistent and many non-persistent filesystems read-only and mounts read/write overlays on top of them if possible. If you mount partitions or drives that were not mounted at bootup, or if you write to locations that livecheck warns you are mounted read/write, any changes made to those locations will be persistent.</p>
<p>If your system has a large quantity of RAM, it may be possible to run VMs without leaving persistent data on the system by creating them while in live mode, and then accepting the fact that they will be wiped on shutdown. This will require that your system has enough RAM to store the entire contents of the VM disk image in memory.</p> ]]></description>

        <dc:creator><![CDATA[@kicker77]]></dc:creator>
        <description><![CDATA[ <p>I live in a country in which the government can demand a person decrypt a drive. My threat model is having someone corrupt demand I decrypt.</p>
<p>I am not worried about the first demand to decrypt. I am worried that if I do decrypt that there will be some sort of information about a hidden partition that could be recovered.</p>
<p>How live is live mode? If I use something like gnome-boxes and load hidden boxes during live mode, and if these boxes are in a hidden partition, will there be any forensic evidence left after live mode that I used hidden partitions?</p>
<p>Can I write to home directory during live mode? Can application write to the home directory during live mode or cache anything? Many applications use .directories in home that are hidden to store files. May this still happen during live mode?</p> ]]></description>

Would it be sufficient if Kicksecure, and Whonix 18 are made available for Qubes R4.3 only?

I.e. would be it be OK if Kicksecure, and Whonix 18 would not be made available for Qubes R4.2?

That would simplify development, maintenance, testing.

Primarily, pull request https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-core-admin-addon-whonix/pull/21 has been merged for Qubes R4.3 but we didn't backport it to Qubes R4.2 yet.

This would cause [qrexec `sdwdate.ConnectCheck` denied messages](https://forum.qubes-os.org/t/whonix-18-denied-sdwdate-connectcheck/36098) on Qubes R4.2.

What's the guestimate for the Qubes R4.3 release date?

<p>Some devices other than storage devices are allowed by the configuration as detailed above. In particular, keyboards and mice can be attached if no other USB keyboard or mouse is attached yet. Additionally, camera and audio devices are now allowed.</p>
<p><code>vim /usr/lib/systemd/system/usbguard.service</code> shows that USBGuard is <code>WantedBy=basic.target</code>, which means it starts pretty early in the boot process (after the core system is operational but before users can log in and a graphical session appears).

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>For the record my Samsung SSD drive that I have been testing around a distro morph on shows that it indeed shows it as class 8 aka mass storage so there should be no issue with the current rule since its booting the system of an external SSD drive.</p>

      bInterfaceClass         8 Mass Storage
user@host:~$
</code></pre>
<p>That means there shouldn’t be any issues with USBGuard an users that choose to install and boot from an external media as such (external SSD/HDD drives etc).</p>
<p>1. Being the current rule allows for USB’s to be allowed that are plugged in before the daemon is loaded (before the computer boots up).</p>
<p>2. External SSD/HDD drives should come up as class 8 Mass Storage which us allow by the policy rule set.</p> ]]></description>

<p>That is what it should do unless you have the USB adapter plugged in before starting up your computer it should be allowed.<br>
Are you testing the config file manually aswell?</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Thanks, I’ll continue to test some things manually. Sorry I missed that part about the version.</p>
<p>Is there anything in the daemon config that adjusts how early in the boot process USBGuard is loaded?</p>
<p>Reason I’m curious being that I noticed that I was able to plug in a non storage device after login screen before the desktop screen was loaded?<br>
I’ll test it again it could just be something else with my system specific to my morph.</p> ]]></description>

</aside>
<p>Exactly. It’s a feature “in the middle” between persistent mode and live mode.</p>
<p>We cannot maintain that. There are way too many features and too little (none) automated testing.</p>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Tor only runs as a system-level service to my awareness, there is no file matching the pattern <code>/usr/lib/systemd/user/*tor*</code> that is actually Tor-related.</p>
<p>The only users in the <code>debian-tor</code> group are <code>canary</code>, <code>systemcheck</code>, and <code>sdwdate</code>. Removing users from that group will probably break things and leave Tor enabled. I’m not quite sure that the “polkit route” is, but it’s worth bearing in mind that things that usually would pop up polkit prompts probably will not work except in sysmaint mode due to SUID stripping. (This isn’t that much of a problem usually since you’re not supposed to run privileged things in a user session.)</p>
<p>Kicksecure isn’t really designed to work without Tor enabled and running. Not only will disabling it break apt and sdwdate, there is code in Kicksecure specifically designed to start Tor if it isn’t running so that things like apt and sdwdate will function. If you have to disable Tor for some reason, then you would need to mask it system-wide, which will break it for both user and sysmaint sessions, require that you un-torify apt sources, leave you without clock synchronization, disable the automatic warrant canary checks, and will potentially make you more vulnerable to some sophisticated attacks. If you’re in an area where Tor is censored, maybe that’s a risk you’re willing to take, but in that instance, masking Tor system-wide is the right thing to do.</p> ]]></description>

        <description><![CDATA[ <p>Hmmm well, if you don’t need the Tor service to run for user you may be able to restrict it for user and only have it enabled for sysmaint for updates/upgrades. Take in mind the sdwdate relies on Tor for time sync also which is imperative for certain things to work correctly like certificates and 2fa applications etc.</p>
<p>If this is the case for you, I wanted to suggest <code>systemctl --user disable tor.service &amp;&amp; systemctl --user mask tor.service</code> if you don’t want the tor daemon running for user <em>user</em> but the tor.service is system wide not a user level service so tha wont work I’m sure? hmmm…</p>
<p>I’m not sure if its a simple thing of removing user from the debian-tor group so you would be best to go the polkit route <span class="mention">@adrelanos</span> <a class="mention" href="https://forums.kicksecure.com/u/arraybolt3">@arraybolt3</a> what do you think?</p>
<p>This use case could documented in the wiki but I personally like the Tor service to load for user since I like to route certain applications through the socks port 9050 like Electrum and Feather wallet.<br>
Please don’t remove or change how Tor is implemented please. I personally think the Tor service should not change as it’s one of the main reasons people may choose to use Kicksecure since its shipped with it making it great for running hidden services on a server.</p> ]]></description>
